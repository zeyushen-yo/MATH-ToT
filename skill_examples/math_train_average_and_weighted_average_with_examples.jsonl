{"problem": "At the Hardey Fitness Center, the management did a survey of their membership. The average age of the female members was 40 years old. The average age of the male members was 25 years old. The average age of the entire membership was 30 years old. What is the ratio of the female to male members? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "solution": "Let $m$ denote the number of male members and $f$ the number of female members.  The sum of the ages of the female members is $40f$ and the sum of the ages of the male members is $25m$.  The sum of the ages of all the members is $40f+25m$, and the total number of members is $f+m$.  Since the average age for all the members is $30$, we have \\[\n\\frac{40f+25m}{f+m}=30.\n\\] Multiply both sides by $f+m$ to get \\[\n40f+25m=30f+30m.\n\\] Collecting like terms we find $10f=5m$ so $f/m=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."}
{"problem": "Dave rode 30 miles at 10 miles per hour and 10 miles at 30 miles per hour. What was his average speed, in miles per hour, for the entire ride?", "solution": "Dave rode a total of $40$ miles.  The $30$ mile segment took $\\frac{30}{10}=3$ hours, while the $10$ mile segment took $\\frac{10}{30}=\\frac{1}{3}$ hours, so the full ride took $3+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{10}{3}$ hours.\n\nSo the average speed was  $\\frac{40}{\\frac{10}{3}}=\\boxed{12}$ miles per hour."}
{"problem": "Antonette gets $70\\%$ on a 10-problem test, $80\\%$ on a 20-problem test and $90\\%$ on a 30-problem test. If the three tests are combined into one 60-problem test, which percent is her overall score, rounded to the nearest percent?", "solution": "Note that $70\\%$ of 10 is 7, $80\\%$ of 20 is 16 and $90\\%$ of 30 is 27. Antonette answers $7+16+27=50$ problems correctly out of 60 problems in all. Her overall score is $\\frac{50}{60}$ or $83.\\overline{3}\\%$. Rounded to the nearest percent, the answer is $\\boxed{83\\%}$."}
{"problem": "The average of the numbers $1, 2, 3,\\dots, 98, 99,$ and $x$ is $100x$. What is $x$?", "solution": "The sum of the numbers 1, 2, 3, $\\dots,$ 99 is $\\frac{99 \\cdot 100}{2} = 4950,$ so $x$ satisfies\n\\[\\frac{4950 + x}{100} = 100x.\\]Solving, we find $x = \\boxed{\\frac{50}{101}}.$"}
{"problem": "The sequence $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3,$ $\\dots$ satisfies $a_1 = 19,$ $a_9 = 99,$ and for all $n \\ge 3,$ $a_n$ is the arithmetic mean of the first $n - 1$ terms.

{"problem": "What is the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7?", "solution": "We use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find that the arithmetic mean of the positive two-digit multiples of 7 is $\\frac{14+21+...+98}{13}=\\frac{1}{13}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot13\\cdot(14+98)=\\boxed{56}$."}
