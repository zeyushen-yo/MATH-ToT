{"problem": "Each day, Jenny ate $20\\%$ of the jellybeans that were in her jar at the beginning of that day. At the end of second day, 32 remained. How many jellybeans were in the jar originally?", "solution": "Since Jenny ate $20\\%$ of the jellybeans remaining each day, $80\\%$ of the jellybeans are left at the end of each day. If $x$ is the number of jellybeans in the jar originally, then $(0.8)^2x=32$. Thus $x=\\boxed{50}$."}
{"problem": "Sixteen is 64$\\%$ of what number?", "solution": "If the number is $x$, we can set up the equation $\\frac{16}{x}=\\frac{64}{100}$. We divide both sides by $4$ to get $\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{4}{100}=\\frac{1}{25}$, so $x=\\boxed{25}$."}
{"problem": "What is $\\frac{1}{4}\\%$ of 120? Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "We have $$\\frac14\\%\\times120=\\frac{\\frac14}{100}\\times120=\\frac{1}{400}\\times120=\\frac{12}{40}=\\frac{3}{10}=\\boxed{.3}.$$"}
{"problem": "Max bought a new dirt bike and paid $10\\%$ of the cost upfront, which was $\\$150$. What was the price of the bike?", "solution": "If $10\\%$ of the price of the dirt bike was $\\$150$, then $100\\%$ of the price must have been ten times the amount that Max paid upfront. Therefore, the price of the bike must have been $10 \\times \\$150=\\boxed{\\$ 1500}$."}
{"problem": "At Academic Academy, to pass an algebra test you must score at least $80\\%$. If there are 35 problems on the test, what is the greatest number you can miss and still pass?", "solution": "If you must score at least $80 \\%$, then you cannot miss more than $20 \\% = 1/5$ of the problems. $1/5$ of $35$ is equal to $7$, so you can miss at most $\\boxed{7}$ problems and still pass."}
{"problem": "Eleven percent of what number is seventy-seven?", "solution": "If the number is $x$, we have $\\frac{11}{100}x=77\\qquad\\Rightarrow x=77\\cdot\\frac{100}{11}=7\\cdot100=700$. The number is $\\boxed{700}$."}
{"problem": "A 1$\\%$ late charge was added to Jenna's bill on the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past its due date. The resulting total was then increased by 1$\\%$ because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days either. Her original bill was $\\$400$. Exactly how much is the bill now?", "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$. Therefore, her final bill is $\\$400(1.01)^2=\\$408.04$."}
{"problem": "Darren has borrowed $100$ clams from Ethan at a $10\\%$ simple daily interest. Meanwhile, Fergie has borrowed $150$ clams from Gertie at a $5\\%$ simple daily interest. In how many days will Darren and Fergie owe the same amounts, assuming that they will not make any repayments in that time period?", "solution": "Let $t$ be the number of days that has passed. Darren's balance, in clams, is $100(1 + 0.10t) = 100 + 10t,$ whereas Fergie's balance, in clams, is $150(1 + 0.05t) = 150 + 7.5t$. Setting them equal to each other, we have $100 + 10t = 150 + 7.5t.$ Collecting like terms, we have $2.5t = 50,$ so $t = \\boxed{20\\text{ days}}.$"}
{"problem": "Anthony made $5$ of his first $12$ free throw attempts. If he makes $2/3$ of his next $24$ attempts, by how many percentage points will he increase his overall success rate percentage? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.", "solution": "If Anthony makes $2/3$ of his next $24$ attempts, he will make another $16$ free throws. Then he will have $5 + 16 = 21$ successful throws in $12 + 24 = 36$ attempts. That's a success rate of $21/36 = 7/12$, which is $58.3\\%$. His success rate before was $5/12$, which is $41.6\\%$. The increase is $58.3 - 41.6 = 16.7$, or $\\boxed{17\\%}$ to the nearest whole number."}
{"problem": "Rural School USA has 105 students enrolled. There are 60 boys and 45 girls. If $\\frac{1}{10}$ of the boys and $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the girls are absent on one day, what percent of the total student population is absent?", "solution": "$\\frac{1}{10}$ of $60$ boys is $60/10=6$ students, while $\\frac{1}{3}$ of $45$ girls is $45/3=15$ students, so $21$ students were absent that day. Since we know that $\\frac{21}{105}=\\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{1}{5}$ is equal to $20\\%$, we know that $\\boxed{20 \\%}$ of the total student population was absent."}
{"problem": "If 25$\\%$ of a number is the same as 20$\\%$ of 30, what is the number?", "solution": "If the number is $x$, we set up the equation $\\frac{25}{100}x=\\frac{20}{100}(30)$, which means $\\frac14x=\\frac15(30)=6$. So $x=6\\cdot4=24$. The number is $\\boxed{24}$."}
{"problem": "The new Perry Hotter book will have a cover price of $\\$25$. The local bookstore is offering two discounts $\\$4.00$ off and $20\\%$ off. A clever shopper realizes that the prices will be different depending on the order in which she claims her discounts. How much more money will she save by taking the better valued approach rather than the other approach? Express your answer in cents.", "solution": "If the clever shopper takes $4 off followed by $20\\%$ off, the book will cost $0.8 \\times (\\$25 - \\$4) = 0.8 \\times \\$21 = \\$16.80$. If she takes $20\\%$ off followed by $4 off, it will cost $(0.8 \\times \\$25) - \\$4 = \\$20 - \\$4 = \\$16.00$. She will save $\\$16.80 - 16.00 = \\$0.80 = \\boxed{80\\text{ cents}}$ by taking the better-valued approach."}
{"problem": "Participation in the local soccer league is $10\\%$ higher this year than it was last year. Also, from last year to this year, the number of males increased by $5\\%$ and the number of females increased by $20\\%$. There were $20$ males participating in the league last year. What fraction of the league's participants is female this year? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "solution": "Since there were $20$ males last year, there are $1.05 \\cdot 20 =21$ males this year.\n\nWe set the number of females last year as $x$. This means that there are $1.2x$ females this year.\n\nIn total, there were $20+x$ people in the league last year, and $1.1 \\cdot (20+x)$ this year. We then have: \\begin{align*}\n22+1.1x &= 21+1.2x \\\\\n1 &= 0.1x \\\\\nx &= 10.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, there were $10$ girls last year. This means there are $1.2 \\cdot 10 =12$ girls this year. So there are $\\frac{12}{12+21}=\\frac{12}{33}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{11}}$ girls out of the participants this year."}
{"problem": "You have 50 dimes and 20 quarters. What percent of the value of your money is in quarters?", "solution": "The amount in quarters is $20\\times25$ cents and the total amount is $50\\times10+20\\times25$ cents. The percent of the value in quarters is $$\\frac{20\\times25}{50\\times10+20\\times25}=\\frac{500}{500+500}=\\frac{500}{1000}=\\boxed{50\\%}.$$"}
{"problem": "On an algebra test, there were $5x$ problems. Lucky Lacy missed $x$ of them. What percent of the problems did she get correct?", "solution": "If Lucky Lacy missed $x$ out of $5x$ problems, then she must have gotten $5x-x=4x$ of them correct. Therefore, the percentage of problems that Lacy got correct is  $\\frac{4x}{5x}=\\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{80}{100}=\\boxed{80 \\%}$."}
{"problem": "What number results when 50 is increased by $120\\%$?", "solution": "Because $120\\%$ of 50 is $1.2(50) = 60$, when we increase 50 by $120\\%$, we get $50 + 60 = \\boxed{110}$.  Alternatively, we could find our answer by multiplying 50 by $1 + 1.2 = 2.2$, which also gives us $\\boxed{110}$."}
{"problem": "A shirt regularly priced at $\\$30$ is on sale for $20\\%$ off. Mary has a coupon that will take another $25\\%$ off of the sale price. What single percent discount would give the same final price as the two successive discounts?", "solution": "Applying a $20\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $1-20\\%=1-0.2=\\frac{4}{5}$.  Similarly, applying a $25\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{3}{4}$.  Applying both discounts, we multiply by $\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{3}{5}=0.6$.  Since $1-0.6=0.4=40\\%$, multiplying by 0.6 gives a $\\boxed{40\\%}$ discount."}
{"problem": "A television's price was discounted $40\\%$ and then slashed another $40\\%$ during a liquidation sale. By what percent has the original price been reduced?", "solution": "Let the original price of the television be $T$. Then the price is now $0.6(0.6T)=0.36T$. Thus overall the price has been reduced by $1-0.36=\\boxed{64\\%}$."}
{"problem": "A recent study found that 60$\\%$ of men and 80$\\%$ of women surveyed support increased funding for particular medical research. The study surveyed 100 men and 900 women. What was the overall percent of the people surveyed who supported increased funding?", "solution": "$60\\%$ of $100$ men is $60$ people.\n\n$80\\%$ of $900$ women is $720$ people.\n\nSo out of $1000$ total people surveyed, $780$ are supportive.
