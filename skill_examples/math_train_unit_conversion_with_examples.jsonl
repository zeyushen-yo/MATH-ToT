{"problem": "Berengere and her American foreign-exchange student Emily are at a bakery in Paris that accepts both euros and American dollars. They want to buy a cake, but neither of them has enough money. If the cake costs 6 euros and Emily has an American five-dollar bill, how many euros does Berengere need to contribute to the cost of the cake if 1 euro = 1.25 USD?", "solution": "The easiest way to solve this problem is to convert everything into euros. Emily's five-dollar bill is equivalent to $5\\text{ USD} \\times \\frac{1\\text{ euro}}{1.25\\text{ USD}}=4\\text{ euros}$. Since the girls need 6 euros between them, Berengere must contribute $6-4=\\boxed{2 \\text{ euros}}$."}
{"problem": "A rectangular box has a volume of 108 cubic feet. How many cubic yards are in the volume of this box?", "solution": "Since there are 3 feet to a yard, there are $3^3=27$ cubic feet to a cubic yard. Thus, there are $108/27=\\boxed{4}$ cubic yards in the volume of the box."}
{"problem": "How many cubic feet are in one cubic yard? One yard is equal to three feet.\n\n[asy]import three;\ncurrentprojection=orthographic(1/2,1/2,1);\ndraw((0,0,0)--(10,0,0)--(10,-10,0)--(0,-10,0)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0,10)--(10,0,10)--(10,-10,10)--(0,-10,10)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0,0)--(0,0,10));\ndraw((10,0,0)--(10,0,10));\ndraw((10,-10,0)--(10,-10,10));\ndraw((0,-10,0)--(0,-10,10));\nlabel(\"1 Cu ft\",(0,-5,-5),E);\ndraw((25,0,0)--(55,0,0)--(55,-30,0)--(25,-30,0)--cycle);\ndraw((25,0,30)--(55,0,30)--(55,-30,30)--(25,-30,30)--cycle);\ndraw((25,0,0)--(25,0,30));\ndraw((55,0,0)--(55,0,30));\ndraw((55,-30,0)--(55,-30,30));\ndraw((25,-30,0)--(25,-30,30));\nlabel(\"1 Cu yd\",(40,0,0),W);\n[/asy]", "solution": "We have $3 \\text{ ft} = 1 \\text{ yd}$. Cubing both sides, we get $27 \\text{ ft}^3 = 1 \\text{ yd}^3$. So there are $\\boxed{27}$ cubic feet in one cubic yard."}
{"problem": "How many cubic feet are in three cubic yards?", "solution": "Cubing both sides of  \\[\n1\\text{ yard}=3\\text{ feet}\n\\] we find that 1 cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet.  Therefore, 3 cubic yards are equal to $27\\cdot3=\\boxed{81}$ cubic feet."}
{"problem": "If Heidi can paint a wall in 45 minutes, what fractional part of the wall can she paint in 9 minutes?", "solution": "Since $9$ minutes is $1/5$ of $45$ minutes, we can find the fractional part of a wall that Heidi can paint in $9$ minutes by dividing the amount of wall that Heidi can paint in $45$ minutes by $5$. Since Heidi can paint a whole wall in $45$ minutes, it follows that she can paint $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$ of a wall in $9$ minutes."}
{"problem": "Topsoil costs $\\$6$ per cubic foot. What is the cost, in dollars, of 5 cubic yards of topsoil?", "solution": "Cubing both sides of the equation $1\\text{ yd.}=3\\text{ ft.}$, we find that $1\\text{ yd.}^3=27\\text{ ft.}^3$.  Therefore, there are $27\\cdot5$ cubic feet in 5 cubic yards.  Multiplying the number of cubic feet by the cost per cubic foot, we find that the total cost is $27\\cdot5\\cdot6=27\\cdot30=\\boxed{810}$ dollars."}
{"problem": "A rectangular room measures 12-feet by 6-feet. How many square yards of carpet are needed to cover the floor of the room?", "solution": "The area of the room is $(12\\text{ ft.}) (6\\text{ ft.})=72$ square feet.  Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, 1 square yard equals 9 square feet.  Therefore, $72/9=\\boxed{8}$ square yards are needed to cover the floor."}
{"problem": "A scale drawing of a park shows that one inch represents 800 feet. A line segment in the drawing that is 4.75 inches long represents how many feet?", "solution": "Each inch of the 4.75-inch line segment represents 800 feet, so the whole line segment represents $4.75\\times800=\\frac{19}{4}\\cdot800=19\\cdot200=\\boxed{3800}$ feet."}
{"problem": "Express $\\frac{165_7}{11_2}+\\frac{121_6}{21_3}$ in base 10.", "solution": "We begin by converting all the numbers to base 10: \\begin{align*} 165_7&=1(7^2)+6(7^1)+5(7^0)=49+42+5=96\\\\\n11_2&=1(2^1)+1(2^0)=2+1=3\\\\\n121_6&=1(6^2)+2(6^1)+1(6^0)=36+12+1=49\\\\\n21_3&=2(3^1)+1(3^0)=6+1=7\n\\end{align*}Thus, the original expression becomes $\\frac{96}{3}+\\frac{49}{7}=32+7=\\boxed{39}$."}
{"problem": "A marathon is $26$ miles and $385$ yards. One mile equals $1760$ yards.\n\nLeila has run ten marathons in her life. If the total distance Leila covered in these marathons is $m$ miles and $y$ yards, where $0\\le y<1760$, what is the value of $y$?", "solution": "If one marathon equals $26$ miles and $385$ yards, then ten marathons equal $260$ miles and $3850$ yards. Those $3850$ yards can be broken down as $2$ miles and $3850 - (2\\cdot 1760) = 3850 - 3520 = 330$ yards. Therefore, $y=\\boxed{330}$."}
