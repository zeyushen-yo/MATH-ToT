{"problem": "Three aluminum cans can be recycled to make a new can. How many new cans can eventually be made from 243 aluminum cans? (Remember that the first new cans that are made can then be recycled into even newer cans!)  Do not include the original 243 cans in your count.", "solution": "We start with $243 = 3^5$ cans. After recycling these cans, we will have made $243\\cdot\\frac13 = 3^4$ new cans. We can then recycle these new cans to make $3^4\\cdot\\frac13 = 3^3$ new cans. Continuing this process, we want to find the sum $3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0$. This is a finite geometric series with first term $81$, common ratio $1/3$, and five terms. Thus, the sum is $\\frac{81\\left(1-\\left(\\frac13\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac13} = \\boxed{121}$."}

{"problem": "If the six digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5 and 8 are randomly arranged into a six-digit positive integer, what is the probability that the integer is divisible by 15? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "solution": "By the fact that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, any arrangement of the digits will be a multiple of 3. To be a multiple of 5, the number must end in one of the fives, which will happen with probability $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. Since any number that is a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5 is a multiple of 15, the probability of it being a multiple of 15 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."}
{"problem": "How many combinations of pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents) and/or dimes (10 cents) are there with a total value of 25 cents?", "solution": "First, we count the number of combinations that include pennies: we could have all pennies, all pennies and one nickel, all pennies and two nickels, all pennies and three nickels, all pennies and four nickels, all pennies and one dime, all pennies and two dimes, all pennies and one dime and one nickel, all pennies and one dime and two nickels.

{"problem": "Nine tiles are numbered $1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 9,$ respectively. Each of three players randomly selects and keeps three of the tiles, and sums those three values. The probability that all three players obtain an odd sum is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$\n", "solution": "In order for a player to have an odd sum, he must have an odd number of odd tiles: that is, he can either have three odd tiles, or two even tiles and an odd tile. Thus, since there are $5$ odd tiles and $4$ even tiles, the only possibility is that one player gets $3$ odd tiles and the other two players get $2$ even tiles and $1$ odd tile. We count the number of ways this can happen. (We will count assuming that it matters in what order the people pick the tiles; the final answer is the same if we assume the opposite, that order doesn't matter.)\n$\\dbinom{5}{3} = 10$ choices for the tiles that he gets. The other two odd tiles can be distributed to the other two players in $2$ ways, and the even tiles can be distributed between them in $\\dbinom{4}{2} \\cdot \\dbinom{2}{2} = 6$ ways. This gives us a total of $10 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 120$ possibilities in which all three people get odd sums.\nIn order to calculate the probability, we need to know the total number of possible distributions for the tiles. The first player needs three tiles which we can give him in $\\dbinom{9}{3} = 84$ ways, and the second player needs three of the remaining six, which we can give him in $\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20$ ways. Finally, the third player will simply take the remaining tiles in $1$ way. So, there are $\\dbinom{9}{3} \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{3} \\cdot 1 = 84 \\cdot 20 = 1680$ ways total to distribute the tiles.\nWe must multiply the probability by 3, since any of the 3 players can have the 3 odd tiles.Thus, the total probability is $\\frac{360}{1680} = \\frac{3}{14},$ so the answer is $3 + 14 = \\boxed{17}$."}

Find the number of possible committees that can be formed subject to these requirements.\n", "solution": "There are two cases:\nCase 1: One man and one woman is chosen from each department.\nCase 2: Two men are chosen from one department, two women are chosen from another department, and one man and one woman are chosen from the third department.\nFor the first case, in each department there are ${{2}\\choose{1}} \\times {{2}\\choose{1}} = 4$ ways to choose one man and one woman.

Thus there are $1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 4 = 4$ ways to choose two men from one department, two women from another department, and one man and one woman from the third department.

The probability that the committee has at least 1 boy and 1 girl is equal to 1 minus the probability that the committee is either all boys or all girls. The number of ways to choose a committee of all boys is $\\binom{10}{5}=252$, the number of ways to choose a committee of all girls is $\\binom{15}{5}=3,\\!003$, and the total number of committees is $\\binom{25}{5}=53,\\!130$, so the probability of selecting a committee of all boys or all girls is $\\dfrac{252+3003}{53,\\!130}=\\dfrac{31}{506}$.

Express your answer as a common fraction.", "solution": "We count the number of ways to draw the tan chips consecutively, the pink chips consecutively, and the violet chips consecutively (although not necessarily in that order).  First of all, we can draw the tan chips in $3!$ ways, the pink chips in $2!$ ways, and the violet chips in $4!$ ways.  We can choose our drawing order (e.g pink-tan-violet) in $3!$ ways.
