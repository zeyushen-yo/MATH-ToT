{"problem": "Each term of a sequence, after the first term, is inversely proportional to the term preceding it, and the constant of proportionality stays the same. If the first term is 2 and the second term is 5, what is the 12th term?", "solution": "Recall that two quantities are inversely proportional if their product is constant.  Therefore, the product of every pair of consecutive terms of the sequence is the same.  Since the first two terms are 2 and 5, the product of every pair of consecutive terms is 10.  Therefore, the third term is $10/5=2$, the fourth term is $10/2=5$, and so on.  We see that the $n$th term is 5 for every even $n$, so the 12th term is $\\boxed{5}$."}
{"problem": "Suppose that $a^2$ varies inversely with $b^3$.

Assuming the taxi fare is directly proportional to distance traveled, how much would Ann be charged (in dollars) if she had traveled 70 miles?", "solution": "Let $d$ equal the cost of a 70 mile taxi ride. Since we know that Ann was charged $120 dollars a 50 mile taxi ride, we can set up the proportion $\\frac{120}{50}=\\frac{d}{70}$. If we solve for $d$ by multiplying both sides by 70, we find that $d=\\left(\\frac{120}{50}\\right)(70)=\\boxed{168}$ dollars."}
{"problem": "The force needed to loosen a bolt varies inversely with the length of the handle of the wrench used. A wrench with a handle length of 9 inches requires 375 pounds of force to loosen a certain bolt. A wrench of 15 inches will require how many pounds of force to loosen the same bolt?", "solution": "When we change from a 9-inch wrench to a 15-inch wrench, we multiply the length of the wrench by $\\frac{15}{9} = \\frac{5}{3}$.  Since the wrench length and the force required are inversely proportional, their product must be constant.  So, when we multiply the wrench length by $\\dfrac53$, we must multiply the force required by $\\dfrac35$ in order to keep their product constant.  So, the force required is $(375)\\left(\\frac35\\right) = \\boxed{225}$ pounds of force."}

Since $f$ is inversely proportional to $d^2$, $f\\cdot d^2=k$ for some constant $k$. Since the force when Bill is on the surface of Earth is 600 Newtons, $k=600\\cdot4000^2=9,\\!600,\\!000,000$.
