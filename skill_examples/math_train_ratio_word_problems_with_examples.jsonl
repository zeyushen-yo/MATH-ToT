{"problem": "Ivan rents a car for $\\$$25 a day and $\\$$0.20 a mile. If he rents it for 4 days and drives it 400 miles, how many dollars does he pay?", "solution": "The cost of renting for four days is $25\\times4=100$ and the cost of driving $400$ miles is $.20\\times400=\\frac{400}{5}=80$. He has to pay $100+80=\\boxed{\\$180}$."}
{"problem": "Mary can mow a lawn in four hours and Tom can mow the lawn in 5 hours. If Tom works for 2 hours alone, what fractional part of the lawn remains to be mowed?", "solution": "If Tom can mow a lawn in $5$ hours, then in one hour, he can mow $1/5$ of the lawn. Since he mows for $2$ hours, he finished mowing $2 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$ of the lawn. This leaves $1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$ of the lawn left to be mowed."}
