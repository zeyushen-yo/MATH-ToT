{"problem": "An octahedron consists of two square-based pyramids glued together along their square bases to form a polyhedron with eight faces. Imagine an ant that begins at the top vertex and walks to one of the four adjacent vertices that he randomly selects and calls vertex A. From vertex A, he will then walk to one of the four adjacent vertices that he randomly selects and calls vertex B. What is the probability that vertex B will be the bottom vertex? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((-10,0)--(10,0)--(3,-15)--cycle);\ndraw((-10,0)--(10,0)--(3,15)--cycle);\ndraw((10,0)--(17,7)--(3,-15)--(17,7)--(3,15));\ndraw((-3,7)--(3,15)--(-3,7)--(17,7)--(-3,7)--(-10,0)--(-3,7)--(3,-15),dashed);\n[/asy]", "solution": "Since the ant starts at the top vertex, his next destination, vertex A, is equally likely to be any of the 4 vertices along the middle ring. Each of these vertices is adjacent to 4 other vertices, and since they are in the middle, exactly 1 of those 4 vertices is the bottom vertex. So, regardless of which intermediate vertex he goes to, the ant will end up at the bottom vertex with $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$ probability, by the symmetry of the 4 intermediate stages."}
{"problem": "A point $(x,y)$ is randomly selected such that $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$. What is the probability that $x+y \\le 4$? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "solution": "We draw the region and mark off the area where $x+y \\le 4$:\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,6)--(0,6)--cycle);\nfill((0,0)--(0,4)--(3,1)--(3,0)--cycle, gray(.7));\ndot((0,0));\ndot((3,0));\ndot((0,6));\ndot((3,6));\ndot((0,4));\ndot((3,1));\nlabel(\"(0,0)\", (0,0), W);\nlabel(\"(0,6)\", (0,6), W);\nlabel(\"(0,4)\", (0,4), W);\nlabel(\"(3,1)\", (3,1), E);\nlabel(\"(3,0)\", (3,0), E);\nlabel(\"(3,6)\", (3,6), E);\n[/asy] The area of the rectangle is 18. The area of the shaded region, a trapezoid, is $\\frac{1}{2}(1+4)\\cdot3=\\frac{15}{2}$. The probability that the point ends up in the shaded region is then $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$."}
{"problem": "Phil has 7 green marbles and 3 purple marbles in a bag. He removes a marble at random, records the color, puts it back, and then repeats this process until he has withdrawn 6 marbles. What is the probability that exactly three of the marbles that he removes are green? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest thousandth.", "solution": "There is a $\\left( \\frac{7}{10} \\right) ^3 \\left( \\frac{3}{10} \\right) ^3 = \\frac{9261}{1000000}$ probability that 3 particular marbles out of 6 will be green and the rest will be purple. There are also  $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose which 3 out of the 6 are the green ones. Because these ways are all mutually exclusive, we multiply to get the probability that we're looking for: $20 \\cdot \\frac{9261}{1000000}\\approx \\boxed{.185}$."}
