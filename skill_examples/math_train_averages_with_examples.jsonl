{"problem": "The average of two 2-digit positive integers is equal to the decimal number obtained by writing one of the two-digit integers before the decimal point and the other two-digit integer after the decimal point. What is the smaller of the two integers?", "solution": "Let the two numbers be $m=AB$ and $n=CD$ (where $A,B,C$ and $D$ are digits). The average of $m$ and $n$ is $\\frac{m+n}{2}$ and the number formed by writing $m$ before the decimal point and $n$ after the decimal point is: $$AB.CD = AB + 0.CD = AB+\\frac{CD}{100} = m+\\frac{n}{100}.$$ Setting these equal gives: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{m+n}{2} &= m+\\frac{n}{100}\\\\\n50m+50n &= 100m+n\\\\\n49n &= 50m\n\\end{align*} From this it follows that $n$ a multiple of 50. As $n$ is a 2-digit positive integer this means that $n=50$. So now $50m = 49n = 49\\cdot 50$, so $m=49$. Thus the integers are $49$ and $50$, so the smaller integer is $\\boxed{49}$."}
{"problem": "The average of Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages is 9. Four years ago,  Chris was the same age as Amy is now. In 3 years, Ben's age will be $\\frac{2}{3}$ of Amy's age at that time. How many years old is Chris now?", "solution": "Let Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages be $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*} \\tag{1}\n\\frac{a+b+c}{3}=9 \\Rightarrow a+b+c&=27 \\\\ \\tag{2}\nc-4&=a\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb+3&=\\frac{2}{3}(a+3)\n\\end{align*} From Equation (3), we have $b=\\frac{2}{3}(a+3)-3$. We substitute Equation (2) into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, to get $b=\\frac{2}{3}(c-1)-3$. Substituting this last equation and Equation (2) into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$ and $b$, we have  \\[[c-4]+[\\frac{2}{3}(c-1)-3]+c=27\\] Solving for $c$, we find that $c=13$. Thus, Chris's age is $\\boxed{13}$."}
{"problem": "Real numbers $x$ and $y$ have an arithmetic mean of 18 and a geometric mean of $\\sqrt{92}$. Find $x^2+y^2$.", "solution": "The givens tell us that $\\frac{x+y}{2}=18$ and $\\sqrt{xy}=\\sqrt{92}$, or $x+y=36$ and $xy=92$. $(x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2$, so  \\[\nx^2+y^2=(x+y)^2-2xy=36^2-2\\cdot92=1296-184=\\boxed{1112}\n\\]"}

{"problem": "The arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean of $a$, $b$, $c$ are $8$, $5$, $3$ respectively. What is the value of $a^2+b^2+c^2$?", "solution": "We start by trying to get as much information as possible from what is given to us about $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since their arithmetic mean is $8$, we know that $\\frac{a+b+c}{3} = 8$ which when we multiply both sides by $3$ gives us $a+b+c=24$. Since their geometric mean is $5$ we have $\\sqrt[3]{abc}=5$, which when we cube both sides gives us $abc = 125$. Now since the harmonic mean is $3$, we have\n$$\\frac{3}{\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}+\\frac{1}{c}}=3.$$We can simplify to get\n$$\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}+\\frac{1}{c} = 1.$$Converting to a common denominator gives\n$$\\frac{ab+bc+ca}{abc}=1$$which tells us that $ab+bc+ca=abc=125$.\n\nNow, we try and use this information to find $a^2+b^2+c^2$. Since we already know $a+b+c$, we can start by squaring that whole expression and expanding. This gives us,\n$$(a+b+c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ca).$$We can rewrite the equation above as\n$$a^2+b^2+c^2=(a+b+c)^2-2(ab+bc+ca).$$Since we know both expressions on the right, we can substitute them in and solve to get\n$$a^2+b^2+c^2=(24)^2-2(125)=576-250=\\boxed{326}.$$"}
