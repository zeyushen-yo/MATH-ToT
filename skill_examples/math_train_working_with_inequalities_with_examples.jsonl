{"problem": "The square root of $x$ is greater than 2 and less than 4. How many integer values of $x$ satisfy this condition?", "solution": "We have: $4 > \\sqrt{x} > 2$.

{"problem": "If $y<0$, find the range of all possible values of $y$ such that $\\lceil{y}\\rceil\\cdot\\lfloor{y}\\rfloor=110$.  Express your answer using interval notation.", "solution": "As long as $y$ is not an integer, we can define $\\lceil{y}\\rceil$ as $x$ and $\\lfloor{y}\\rfloor$ as $x-1$. If we plug these expressions into the given equation, we get  \\begin{align*} x(x-1)&=110\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2-x&=110\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2-x-110&=0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x-11)(x+10)&=0\n\\end{align*}This yields $x=11$ and $x=-10$ as two possible values of $x$. However since the problem states that $y<0$ and $x=\\lceil{y}\\rceil$, $x$ cannot be a positive integer. This allows us to eliminate $11$, leaving the $-10$ as the only possible value of $x$. Since $x=\\lceil{y}\\rceil=-10$, and $x-1=\\lfloor{y}\\rfloor=-11$, $y$ must be between the integers $-10$ and $-11$. Therefore, our final answer is $-11<y<-10,$ or $y \\in \\boxed{(-11, -10)}$ in interval notation."}
{"problem": "If $x$ is a real number and $x^2-7x+6<0$, what are the possible values for $x$? Use interval notation to express your answer.", "solution": "Factoring the quadratic gives $(x-1)(x-6)<0$, which means that $x-1$ and $x-6$ must have opposite signs, since the product of two factors with the same sign is positive. Now, we split into four cases. If $x<1$, then both factors are negative. If $x>6$, both factors are positive. If $x=1$ or $x=6$, one of the factors is zero. If $1<x<6$, $x-6$ is negative and $x-1$ is positive, meaning the inequality is satisfied. So our only possible range is $1<x<6$, giving interval notation of $\\boxed{(1,6)}$."}
{"problem": "How many integers, $x$, satisfy $|5x - 3| \\le 7$?", "solution": "We'll consider two cases.\n\n\nCase 1: $5x-3$ is nonnegative.  If $5x-3$ is nonnegative, then $|5x-3| = 5x-3$, so we have $5x - 3 \\le 7$.  Solving this gives $x \\le 2$.  The only integers for which $x\\le 2$ and $5x-3$ is nonnegative are $1$ and $2$.\n\nCase 2: $5x-3$ is negative.  If $5x - 3$ is negative, then $|5x-3| = -(5x-3)$, so the inequality becomes $-(5x-3) \\le 7$.  Multiplying by $-1$ gives $5x-3 \\ge -7$, so $5x \\ge -4$, which means $x \\ge -0.8$.

From the problem, we have $f \\ge 6+s/2$ and $f \\le 2s$.  Putting these together, we have $2s \\ge f \\ge 6 +s/2$.

{"problem": "What is the least integer value of $x$ such that  $\\lvert2x+ 7\\rvert\\le 16$?", "solution": "Clearly, the inequality has some solutions for which $2x+7$ is negative.  For example, if $x = -4$, then $2x+7 = -1$, so $|2x+7| = 1$, which is less than 16.  As we make $x$ even smaller, $2x+7$ gets even more less than zero, so $|2x+7|$ gets larger.  But how small can we make $x$?  To figure this out, we note that if $2x+7$ is negative, then $|2x+7| = -(2x+7)$.  Then, our inequality becomes $-(2x+7) \\le 16$.  Multiplying both sides by $-1$ (and flipping the direction of the inequality symbol) gives $2x +7 \\ge -16$.  Subtracting 7 and then dividing by 2 gives $x \\ge -11.5$.  So, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ is $\\boxed{-11}$.  Checking, we see that when $x=-11$, we have $|2x + 7| = 15$, which is less than 16."}
{"problem": "How many integers satisfy the inequality $(x+3)^{2}\\leq1$?", "solution": "Distributing the left side of the inequality, we have $x^{2}+6x+9\\leq1$, which simplifies to $x^{2}+6x+8\\leq0$.

We know that the signs in each of these regions alternate, and we test any number in each of the regions to make sure. Plugging into $(x+2)(x+4)$, any $x$ less than $-4$ yields a positive product, and any $x$ greater than $-2$ also yields a positive product. The remaining interval between $-2$ and $-4$ inclusive yields a nonpositive product. Thus, there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers which satisfy the inequality: $-2, -3$, and $-4$."}

{"problem": "Find all $c$ which satisfy $$\\frac{c}{3} \\le 2+c < -2(1+c).$$Express your answer in interval notation, simplifying any fractions which occur in your answer.", "solution": "We have two inequalities which $c$ must satisfy. We consider these inequalities one at a time.\n\nThe first inequality is $\\frac{c}{3}\\le 2+c$. Multiplying both sides by $3$, we have $$c\\le 6+3c.$$Subtracting $3c$ from both sides gives $$-2c\\le 6.$$We can divide both sides by $-2$, but we must reverse the inequality since $-2$ is negative.

Expanding the right side, we have $$2+c < -2-2c.$$Adding $2c-2$ to both sides gives $$3c<-4.$$Dividing both sides by $3$ gives $c<-\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nSo, all $c$ which satisfy both inequalities are given by $-3\\le c<-\\frac{4}{3}$, or, in interval notation, $c\\in\\boxed{\\left[-3,-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)}$."}
{"problem": "What is the value of $b$ if $-x^2+bx-5<0$ only when $x\\in (-\\infty, 1)\\cup(5,\\infty)$?", "solution": "When $x<1$ or $x>5$, $-x^2+bx-5<0$. That means that $-x^2+bx-5=0$ at $x=1$ and $x=5$. So, the parabola has roots at 1 and 5, giving us $(x-1)(x-5)=0$. However, we also know the parabola opens downwards since the coefficient of $x^2$ is negative, so we have to negate one of the factors. We can now write $-x^2+bx-5=(1-x)(x-5)=-x^2+6x-5$. Thus, $b=\\boxed{6}$."}
{"problem": "Find all positive values of $c$ so that the inequality $x^2-6x+c<0$ has real solutions for $x$. Express your answer in interval notation.", "solution": "We know that $x^2-6x+c$ must be negative somewhere, but since it opens upward (the leading coefficient is $1$) it must also be positive somewhere. This means it must cross the $x$-axis, so it must have real roots. If it has only $1$ real root, the quadratic will be tangent to the $x$-axis and will never be negative, so it must have $2$ real roots. Thus the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ must be positive. So we have $(-6)^2-4(1)(c)>0$, giving $36-4c>0\\Rightarrow 36>4c\\Rightarrow 9>c$. Since $c$ must be positive, we have $0<c<9$, or $\\boxed{(0,9)}$."}

{"problem": "Find all real numbers $x$ such that \\[3 \\le \\frac{x}{2x-5} < 8.\\](Give your answer in interval notation.)", "solution": "We work on the two parts of the given inequality separately.
