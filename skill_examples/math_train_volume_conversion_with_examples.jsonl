{"problem": "A two-gallon container had all of its dimensions tripled. How many gallons does the new container hold?", "solution": "Suppose that our two-gallon container is in the shape of a rectangular prism. If we triple the length, the volume triples. Tripling the width or the height gives us the same result. Therefore, tripling all of the dimensions increases the volume by a factor of $3\\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 27$. The new container can hold $2 \\times 27 = \\boxed{54}$ gallons."}
{"problem": "For his birthday, Bert gets a box that holds $125$ jellybeans when filled to capacity. A few weeks later, Carrie gets a larger box full of jellybeans. Her box is twice as high, twice as wide and twice as long as Bert's. Approximately, how many jellybeans did Carrie get?", "solution": "Since the exact dimensions of Bert's box do not matter, assume the box is $1 \\times 2 \\times 3$.  Its volume is 6.  Carrie's box is $2 \\times 4 \\times 6$, so its volume is 48 or 8 times the volume of Bert's box.  Carrie has approximately $8(125) = \\boxed{1000}$ jellybeans.\n$\\textbf{Note:}$ Other examples may help to see that the ratio is always 8 to 1."}
