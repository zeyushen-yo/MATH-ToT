{"problem": "The measure of each exterior angle of a regular polygon is $30$ degrees. What is the sum of the measures of the interior angles, in degrees?", "solution": "Taking one exterior angle per vertex, the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$. If each exterior angle is $30^\\circ$, then the polygon has $\\frac{360}{30}=12$ sides. The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$, so for a polygon with 12 sides, the sum of the interior angles is $180(12-2)=\\boxed{1800}$ degrees."}
{"problem": "A regular polygon has an exterior angle that measures $15$ degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?", "solution": "The sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$ as long as we take only one exterior angle per vertex. The polygon is regular, so all of the exterior angles have the same degree measure of $15$ degrees. If the polygon has $n$ sides, then the sum of the exterior angles is $15n=360$. So $n=24$ and the polygon has $\\boxed{24}$ sides."}
{"problem": "A regular polygon has exterior angles each measuring 15 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?", "solution": "The measure of each exterior angle in a regular $n$-gon is $360/n$ degrees.  Setting this expression equal to 15, we find $n=\\boxed{24}$."}
{"problem": "In $\\triangle ABC$ the ratio $AC:CB$ is $3:4$. The bisector of the exterior angle at $C$ intersects $BA$ extended at $P$ ($A$ is between $P$ and $B$).

Draw $X$, where $X$ is on $BC$ and $AC \\parallel PX$. By AA Similarity, $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle PBX$, so $PX = 3an$, $BX = 4an$, and $CX = 4an - 4n$.\nAlso, let $\\angle ABC = a$ and $\\angle BAC = b$. Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\\circ}$, $\\angle BCA = 180-a-b$. By Exterior Angle Theorem, $\\angle ACX = a+b$, and since $CP$ bisects $\\angle ACX$, $\\angle PCX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$. Because $AC \\parallel PX$, $\\angle BXP = 180 - a - b$. Thus, $\\angle CPX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$, making $\\triangle CPX$ an isosceles triangle.\nBecause $\\triangle CPX$ is isosceles, $PX = CX$, so $4an - 4n = 3an$. That means $a = 4$, so $PB = 4 \\cdot AB$. Thus, $PA = PB - AB = 3 \\cdot AB$, so $PA : AB = \\boxed{3:1}$."}
