{"problem": "Karen drove continuously from 9:40 a.m. until 1:20 p.m. of the same day and covered a distance of 165 miles. What was her average speed in miles per hour?", "solution": "Average speed is defined as distance traveled divided by time traveled. Karen drove 165 miles in $3\\frac{40}{60}=3\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{11}{3}$ hours, so her average speed was $\\frac{165}{\\frac{11}{3}}=3\\cdot15=\\boxed{45}$ miles per hour."}
{"problem": "A car travels the 120 miles from $A$ to $B$ at 60 miles per hour, and then returns to $A$ on the same road. If the average rate of the round trip is 45 miles per hour, what is the rate, in miles per hour, of the car traveling back from $B$ to $A$?", "solution": "Let $d$ denote the number of miles in the distance from $A$ to $B$ and let $r$ denote the speed of the car (in miles per hour) on the return trip.  It takes $d/60$ hours to travel from $A$ to $B$ and $d/r$ hours to travel from $B$ to $A$.  Round trip, $2d$ miles are covered in $d/60+d/r$ hours for an average speed of  \\[\n\\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{60}+\\frac{d}{r}} \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{60}{d}}{\\frac{60}{d}} =\n\\frac{120}{1+\\frac{60}{r}}\n\\] Setting this expression equal to $45$, we find $r=\\boxed{36}$."}
{"problem": "It takes Mary 30 minutes to walk uphill 1 km from her home to school, but it takes her only 10 minutes to walk from school to home along the same route. What is her average speed, in km/hr, for the round trip?", "solution": "Mary walks a total of 2 km in 40 minutes. Because 40 minutes is 2/3  hr, her average speed, in km/hr, is  $\\dfrac{2\\text{ km}}{2/3\\text{ hr}} = \\boxed{3}\\text{ km/hr}.$"}
{"problem": "Xanthia can read 100 pages per hour and Molly can read 50 pages per hour. If they each read the same book, and the book has 225 pages, how many more minutes than Xanthia would it take for Molly to finish reading the book?", "solution": "Reading the book takes Xanthia\n\n$\\frac{225}{100}=2.25$ hours.\n\nIt takes Molly\n\n$\\frac{225}{50}=4.5$ hours.\n\nThe difference is $2.25$ hours, or $2.25(60)=\\boxed{135}$ minutes."}
{"problem": "A squirrel travels at a constant 4 miles per hour. How long does it take for this squirrel to travel 1 mile? Express your answer in minutes.", "solution": "Using the formula $time = \\frac{distance}{rate}$, we see that it takes the squirrel $\\frac{1}{4}$ hour to travel 1 mile. This is equal to $\\boxed{15}$ minutes."}
{"problem": "It takes 24 minutes for Jana to walk one mile. At that rate, how far in miles will she walk in 10 minutes? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.", "solution": "Using dimensional analysis, we have $\\dfrac{1\\mbox{ mile}}{24\\mbox{ min}} \\times 10\\mbox{ min} = \\dfrac{5}{12}$ miles, or $\\boxed{0.4\\mbox{ miles}}$ to the nearest tenth."}
{"problem": "How many miles can a car travel in 20 minutes if it travels $ \\, \\frac{3}{4} \\, $ as fast as a train going 80 miles per hour?", "solution": "The car travels at a speed of $$\\frac{3}{4}\\times80\\text{ miles per hour}=3\\times20=60\\text{ miles per hour}.$$ In $20$ minutes, the car travels $$\\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{60\\text{ minutes}}\\times20\\text{ minutes}=1\\times20=\\boxed{20\\text{ miles}}.$$"}
{"problem": "A freight train travels 1 mile in 1 minute 30 seconds. At this rate, how many miles will the train travel in 1 hour?", "solution": "The train travels 1 mile in 1 minute 30 seconds. Then it will travel 2 miles in 3 minutes. Since 60 minutes contains 20 groups of 3 minutes, the train will travel $20 \\times 2 = \\boxed{40}$ miles in 1 hour."}
{"problem": "At the beginning of my bike ride I feel good, so I can travel   20 miles per hour.  Later, I get tired and travel only 12 miles  per hour.  If I travel a total of 122 miles in a total time of   8 hours, for how many hours did I feel good?  Express your  answer as a common fraction.", "solution": "Let $x$ equal the number of hours that you felt good riding.  Then, $x$ hours were spent traveling at 20 mph, and $8-x$ hours were spent traveling at 12 mph.  During this time, a total of 122 miles was traveled.  Remembering that $d=r\\cdot t$, we can add the two distances, set this equal to 122 miles, and solve for $x$ as shown: \\begin{align*}\n20(x)+12(8-x)&=122\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 20x+96-12x&=122\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 8x&=26\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=26/8=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{4}}\n\\end{align*}"}
{"problem": "Joann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for three and a half hours. If her friend, Fran, rides for 3 hours, at what average speed, in miles per hour, would she have to ride her bike to travel the same distance that Joann traveled?", "solution": "In $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, Joann covers $\\left(3\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ hours}\\right)(12\\text{ mph})=42$ miles.  If Fran's average speed in miles per hour is $s$, then Fran covers $3s$ miles in $3$ hours.  Solving $3s=42$ we find $s=\\boxed{14}$ miles per hour."}
{"problem": "A particular novel contains $40,\\!000$ words. If the author completed the novel in $80$ hours, on average how many words per hour did she write?", "solution": "We find the average words per hour by dividing the total words by the total hours. $$\\frac{40,\\!000\\text{ words}}{80\\text{ hours}}=\\frac{4,\\!000}{8}=\\frac{40\\cdot100}{8}=5\\cdot100=\\boxed{500} \\text{ words per hour}$$"}
{"problem": "Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. If it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, using the same rates, how many minutes would it take Jordan to run 5 miles?", "solution": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles."}
{"problem": "Margo walks to her friend's house in 10 minutes. Using the same route, it takes Margo 20 minutes to get back home. If her average walking rate for the entire trip is 4 miles per hour, how many total miles did she walk?", "solution": "Margo walked for a total of $10+20=30$ minutes, or 0.5 hours.  To find the total distance traveled, we can multiply the total time by the rate: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{distance}&=\\text{rate}\\times \\text{time} \\\\\n&=0.5\\times 4 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{2}\\text{ miles}.\n\\end{align*}"}
{"problem": "June and Julia live 1 mile apart. It takes June 4 minutes to ride her bike directly to Julia's house. At the same rate, how many minutes would it take June to ride the 3.5 miles from her own house to Bernard's house?", "solution": "Since it takes June 4 minutes to travel 1 mile, it takes her $4\\times3.5=\\boxed{14}$ minutes to travel 3.5 miles."}
