For a regular hexagon, the interior angles sum to $180(4)$, so each interior angle has a measure of $\\frac{180(4)}{6}=30\\cdot4=120^\\circ$. Since $\\overline{PO}$ and $\\overline{PQ}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, $\\triangle POQ$ is an isosceles triangle. The two base angles are congruent and sum to a degree measure of $180-120=60^\\circ$, so each base angle has a measure of $30^\\circ$. There are now a couple approaches to finishing the problem.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 1}$: We use the fact that trapezoid $PQLO$ is an isosceles trapezoid to solve for $x$ and $y$. Since $\\overline{PO}$ and $\\overline{QL}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $PQLO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal. So we know that $x+30=y$. Since the interior angle of a hexagon is $120^\\circ$ and $m\\angle PQO=30^\\circ$, we know that $\\angle OQL$ is a right angle. The acute angles of a right triangle sum to $90^\\circ$, so $x+y=90$. Now we can solve for $x$ with $x+(x+30)=90$, which yields $x=30$. The degree measure of $\\angle LOQ$ is $\\boxed{30^\\circ}$.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 2}$: We use the fact that trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid to solve for $x$. Since $\\overline{NO}$ and $\\overline{ML}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal. The interior angles of a trapezoid sum to $360^\\circ$, so we have $2z+120+120=360$, which yields $z=60$. Angle $O$ is an interior angle of a hexagon that measure $120^\\circ$, so $z+x+30=120$. We found that $z=60$, so $x=30$. The degree measure of $\\angle LOQ$ is $\\boxed{30^\\circ}$.\n\n[asy]\npen sm=fontsize(9);\ndraw((-2,0)--(-1,1.73205081)--(1,1.73205081)--(2,0)--(1,-1.73205081)--(-1,-1.73205081)--cycle);\ndraw((-1,-1.73205081)--(1,1.73205081)--(1,-1.73205081)--cycle);\nlabel(\"L\",(-1,-1.73205081),SW);\nlabel(\"M\",(-2,0),W);\nlabel(\"N\",(-1,1.73205081),NW);\nlabel(\"O\",(1,1.73205081),N);\nlabel(\"P\",(2,0),E);\nlabel(\"Q\",(1,-1.73205081),S);\nlabel(\"$120^\\circ$\", (2,0), W, sm);\nlabel(\"$120^\\circ$\", (-2,0), E, sm);\nlabel(\"$120^\\circ$\", (-1,1.73205081), SE, sm);\nlabel(\"$30^\\circ$\", (1,0.93205081), SE, sm);\nlabel(\"$x^\\circ$\", (0.8,1.53205081)-(0,0.2), S, sm);\nlabel(\"$z^\\circ$\", (0.9,1.73205081), SW, sm);\nlabel(\"$30^\\circ$\", (1,-0.93205081), NE, sm);\npair O=(1,1.73205081), Q=(1,-1.73205081), L=(-1,-1.73205081);\nlabel(\"$y^\\circ$\", L+(0.1,0.1), ENE, sm);\nlabel(\"$z^\\circ$\", L+(0,0.2), N, sm);\ndraw(rightanglemark(O,Q,L));\n[/asy]"}
{"problem": "The measures of the interior angles of a convex hexagon form an increasing arithmetic sequence. How many such sequences are possible if the hexagon is not equiangular and all of the angle degree measures are positive integers less than $150$ degrees?", "solution": "The number of degrees in a hexagon is $(6-2) \\cdot 180=720$ degrees. Setting the degree of the smallest angle to be $x$, and the increment to be $d$, we get that the sum of all of the degrees is $x+x+d+x+2d+x+3d+x+4d+x+5d=6x+15d=720$. We want $15d$ to be even so that adding it to an even number $6x$ would produce an even number $720$. Therefore, $d$ must be even. The largest angle we can have must be less than $150$, so we try even values for $d$ until we get an angle that's greater or equal to $150$.  Similarly, we can conclude that $x$ must be a multiple of 5.\n\nThe largest angle is $x + 5d.$  We notice that, if we divide both sides of $6x + 15d = 720$ by 3, we get $2x + 5d = 240.$  For $x + 5d < 150,$ we must have $x > 90.$  The largest value of $d$ occurs when $x = 95$ and $5d = 240 - 2x = 240 - 2 \\cdot 95 = 240 - 190 = 50,$ or $d = 10.$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ values for $d$: $2,4,6,8,$ and $10$."}
{"problem": "The angles of quadrilateral $ABCD$ satisfy  $\\angle A = 2\\angle B =\n3\\angle C = 4\\angle D$.  What is the degree measure of $\\angle A$, rounded to the nearest whole number?", "solution": "Let $x$ be the degree measure of $\\angle A$.  Then the degree measures of angles $B$, $C$,  and $D$ are $x/2$, $x/3$, and $x/4$, respectively.  The degree measures of the four angles have a sum of 360, so \\[\n360 = x+\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{x}{3}+\\frac{x}{4} =\n\\frac{25x}{12}.\n\\]Thus $x=(12\\cdot 360)/25 = 172.8\\approx \\boxed{173}$."}
{"problem": "Let $P_1$ be a regular $r~\\mbox{gon}$ and $P_2$ be a regular $s~\\mbox{gon}$ $(r\\geq s\\geq 3)$ such that each interior angle of $P_1$ is $\\frac{59}{58}$ as large as each interior angle of $P_2$. What's the largest possible value of $s$?\n", "solution": "The formula for the interior angle of a regular sided polygon is $\\frac{(n-2)180}{n}$.\nThus, $\\frac{\\frac{(r-2)180}{r}}{\\frac{(s-2)180}{s}} = \\frac{59}{58}$. Cross multiplying and simplifying, we get $\\frac{58(r-2)}{r} = \\frac{59(s-2)}{s}$. Cross multiply and combine like terms again to yield $58rs - 58 \\cdot 2s = 59rs - 59 \\cdot 2r \\Longrightarrow 118r - 116s = rs$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\frac{116s}{118 - s}$.\n$r \\ge 0$ and $s \\ge 0$, making the numerator of the fraction positive. To make the denominator positive, $s < 118$; the largest possible value of $s$ is $117$.\nThis is achievable because the denominator is $1$, making $r$ a positive number $116 \\cdot 117$ and $s = \\boxed{117}$."}
{"problem": "Let $n$ equal the number of sides in a regular polygon. For $3\\leq n < 10$, how many values of $n$ result in a regular polygon where the common degree measure of the interior angles is not an integer?", "solution": "The number of degrees is the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$.  If the $n$-gon is regular, then each angle measures $\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$ degrees.  If $n=3$, 4, 5, 6, or 9, then $n$ divides evenly into 180, so the number of degrees in each angle is an integer.  If $n=7$, then the number of degrees is $180\\cdot5/7=900/7$, which is not an integer.  If $n=8$, the number of degrees in each angle is $180\\cdot 6/8=135$.  Therefore, only $\\boxed{1}$ value of $n$ between 3 and 9 results in a non-integer degree measure for each interior angle of a regular $n$-gon."}
