Now we apply the Euclidean algorithm to the first pair of numbers to find \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}(9118,12,\\!173) &= \\text{gcd}(9118,12,\\!173-9118) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(9118,3055). \\\\\n\\end{align*}We could continue to apply the Euclidean algorithm as usual, but instead we note that $\\text{gcd}(9118,3055)=\\text{gcd}(9118,3055\\div 5)$, since 9118 is not divisible by 5. We find \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}(9118,12,\\!173) &= \\text{gcd}(9118,3055 \\div 5) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(9118,611) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(611,9118-611\\times 15) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(611,-47) \\\\\n&= 47,\n\\end{align*}since long division shows that 611 is divisible by 47. Note that we chose 15 as the number of 611's to subtract from 9118 by dividing 9118 by 611 and rounding up to the nearest integer. Finally, we verify that 33,182 is divisible by 47. Altogether, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}(9118, 12,\\!173, 33,\\!182) &= \\text{gcd}(\\text{gcd}(9118, 12,\\!173), 33,\\!182) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}(47, 33,\\!182)\\\\ &=\\boxed{47}.\n\\end{align*}"}

Therefore, $n$ and 4 are relatively prime and have a greatest common divisor of 1.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 share a common factor of 2.

{"problem": "When the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two integers are multiplied, the product is 180.

Hence, in this case, $ab = 180$.  The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, so $a = 2^p \\cdot 3^q \\cdot 5^r$ and $b = 2^s \\cdot 3^t \\cdot 5^u$ for some nonnegative integers $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$, $t$, and $u$.  Then $ab = 2^{p + s} \\cdot 3^{q + t} \\cdot 5^{r + u}$.
