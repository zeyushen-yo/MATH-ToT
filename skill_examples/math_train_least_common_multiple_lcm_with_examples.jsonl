{"problem": "What is the least whole number that is divisible by 7, but leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer 2 through 6?", "solution": "If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, then $n-1$ is divisible by all of those integers. In other words, $n-1$ is a multiple of the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Prime factorizing 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we find that their least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5=60$. Thus the possible values for an integer $n$ which is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 61, 121, 181, 241, 301 and so on. Checking them one at a time, we find that the least of these integers which is divisible by 7 is $\\boxed{301}$."}
{"problem": "Given that $n$ is a positive integer, and given that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$, what is $n$?", "solution": "We know that both $72$ and $108$ are multiples of $n$, so $108-72=36$ is also a multiple of $n$. That is, $n$ is a divisor of $36$.\n\nNote that $24$ is not divisible by $3^2$, but $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$ is divisible by $3^2$. This implies that $n$ is a multiple of $3^2$.\n\nSimilarly, $27$ is not divisible by $2^2$, but $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$ is divisible by $2^2$. This implies that $n$ is a multiple of $2^2$.\n\nThe only divisor of $36$ that is a multiple of $3^2$ and $2^2$ is $36$ itself. Thus, $n=\\boxed{36}$."}
{"problem": "What is the smallest number divisible by integers 1 through 9?", "solution": "To find the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we ignore 1 and prime factorize the rest to obtain $2, 3, 2^2, 5, 2\\cdot 3, 7, 2^3$, and $3^2$. Taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find that the least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{2520}$."}
{"problem": "What is the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25?", "solution": "Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.  Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.\n\nA nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5. If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25.  Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.\n\nSince 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\\boxed{525}$."}
{"problem": "What is the smallest integer $k$ such that $k>1$ and $k$ has remainder $1$ when divided by any of $17,$ $6,$ and $2?$", "solution": "We can re-write the problem as the following three equations: $$k = 17a+1\\\\k = 6b+1 \\\\ k = 2c + 1$$Therefore, $k-1$ is divisible by $17,$ $6,$ and $2.$ The smallest positive value of $k-1$ is thus $$\\text{lcm}[17,6,2] = \\text{lcm}[17,6] = 17\\cdot 6 = 102,$$and so the smallest possible value of $k$ is $k = 102+1 = \\boxed{103}.$"}
{"problem": "What is the least positive integer that satisfies the following conditions?\n\na) When divided by 2, the remainder is 1.\n\nb) When divided by 3, the remainder is 2.\n\nc) When divided by 4, the remainder is 3.\n\nd) When divided by 5, the remainder is 4.", "solution": "Let the smallest common solution be $a$. The given system of congruences is \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 1\\equiv -1\\pmod 2,\\\\\na\\equiv 2\\equiv -1\\pmod 3,\\\\\na\\equiv 3\\equiv -1\\pmod 4,\\\\\na\\equiv 4\\equiv -1\\pmod 5.\n\\end{align*} Note that if $a\\equiv-1\\pmod 4$, then $a\\equiv-1\\pmod 2$ as well,  so we need only consider the final three congruences. Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\\equiv -1\\pmod{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\\equiv 59\\pmod{60}$.\n\nSo $a$ has a lower bound of $59$, but $59$ also happens to satisfy all of the original congruences. Thus, $a=\\boxed{59}$."}

Therefore, the least common multiple of 135 and 468 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{7020}$."}
{"problem": "When Carlos divides his marbles into groups of six, seven, or eight, he has one marble left over. Assuming Carlos has more than one marble, what is the smallest possible number of marbles in Carlos's collection?", "solution": "Let $N$ be the number of marbles. We know that for some integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c,$ $$N = 6a+1,\\\\N = 7b+1, \\\\N = 8c +1.$$In other words, $N-1$ is divisible by $6,$ $7,$ and $8.$ We have $$\\text{lcm}[6,7,8] = \\text{lcm}[3,7,8]= 3\\cdot 7\\cdot 8 = 168,$$and so $168$ divides $N-1.$ The smallest possible value of $N$ greater than $1$ is $N = 168+1 = \\boxed{169}.$"}
{"problem": "What is the least positive integer greater than 1 that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by each of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?", "solution": "If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by all of these numbers then $n-1$ is a multiple of all of these.  We compute the LCM of these numbers as  \\begin{align*}\n\\text{lcm}(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)&=\\text{lcm}(5,6,7,8,9)\\\\\n&=\\text{lcm}(5,7,8,9)\\\\\n&=5\\cdot7\\cdot8\\cdot9\\\\\n&=2520.\n\\end{align*} The smallest $n>1$ that satisfies $2520\\mid n-1$ is $n=\\boxed{2521}$."}
{"problem": "For the opening home game of the baseball season, the Madd Batters minor league baseball team offered the following incentives to its fans:\n\nEvery 75th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free hot dog.\n\nEvery 30th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free cup of soda.\n\nEvery 50th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free bag of popcorn.\n\nThe stadium holds 4000 fans and was completely full for this game. How many of the fans at the game were lucky enough to receive all three free items?", "solution": "We are asked to count the common multiples of $\\{75,30,50\\}$ among the positive integers less than or equal to $4000$.  Since $75=3\\cdot 5^2$, $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot 5$, and $50=2\\cdot 5^2$, the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2=150$.  Since every common multiple is divisible by the least common multiple, we may count the multiples of $150$ less than $4000$. We divide $4000$ by $150$ and find a quotient of $\\boxed{26}$."}
