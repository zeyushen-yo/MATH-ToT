{"problem": "Find the mean of all solutions for $x$ when $x^3 + 3x^2 - 10x = 0$.", "solution": "First, we factor the equation as $x(x^2 +3x - 10) = 0$.  So, one solution is $x=0$ and the other two solutions are the solutions to $x^2 + 3x-10=0$.  We could either factor the quadratic, or note that the sum of the solutions to this quadratic is $-(3/1)=-3$, so the mean of the three solutions to the original equation is $-3/3=\\boxed{-1}$."}
{"problem": "For each positive integer $n$, the mean of the first $n$ terms of a sequence is $n$. What is the 2008th term of the sequence?", "solution": "Let $a_n$ denote the $n$th term.  Then\n\\[\\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{2008}}{2008} = 2008,\\]so $a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{2008} = 2008^2.$\n\nAlso,\n\\[\\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{2007}}{2007} = 2007,\\]so $a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{2007} = 2007^2.$  Subtracting these equations, we get\n\\[a_{2008} = 2008^2 - 2007^2 = (2008 + 2007)(2008 - 2007) = \\boxed{4015}.\\]"}
