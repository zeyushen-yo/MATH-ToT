{"problem": "What is the smallest positive multiple of $23$ that is $4$ more than a multiple of $89$?", "solution": "Let $23a$ be the multiple we seek. Thus $$23a\\equiv 4\\pmod{89}.$$ Multiplying both sides of this equation by $4$, then reducing modulo $89$, gives: \\begin{align*}\n92a &\\equiv 16 \\pmod{89} \\\\\n3a &\\equiv 16 \\pmod{89}\n\\end{align*} Multiplying both sides by $30$, then reducing again, gives: \\begin{align*}\n90a &\\equiv 480 \\pmod{89} \\\\\na &\\equiv 480-445 = 35 \\pmod{89}\n\\end{align*} All of these steps are reversible, so $35$ is the unique solution $\\pmod{89}$ to the original congruence. The smallest positive solution is $a=35$, giving $23a=\\boxed{805}$. (Indeed, we can check that $805 = 9\\cdot 89 + 4$.)"}
{"problem": "Find the product of $1011_2 \\cdot 101_2$.  Express your answer in base 2.", "solution": "We carry out the multiplication as we carry out multiplication in base $10$. Fortunately, we do not have to worry about carrying over, since we are only multiplying by digits of $0$ or $1$.

{"problem": "Find a positive integer that is divisible by 18 and whose cube root is a number between 8 and 8.1.", "solution": "We want an integer $n$ such that $8 < \\sqrt[3]{n} < 8.1$. Cubing each part of the inequality gives $8^3 < n < 8.1^3$, or $512 < n < 531.441$. We know $n$ is a multiple of 18, so we try to find a multiple of 18 in this range (we can do this by letting $n = 18k$, and trying out different integer values of $k$). We find that $18 \\cdot 29 = 522$ is the only multiple of 18 in this range. So $\\boxed{522}$ is the answer."}
{"problem": "What is the units digit of the product of the first three positive composite numbers?", "solution": "The first three positive composite numbers are 4, 6, and 8. The units digit of their product, $4\\cdot6\\cdot8=192$, is $\\boxed{2}$."}
{"problem": "In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?", "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students."}
{"problem": "Billy and Bobbi each selected a positive integer less than 200. Billy's number is a multiple of 18, and Bobbi's number is a multiple of 24. What is the probability that they selected the same number? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "solution": "We must first find how many positive integers less than 200 are multiples of both 18 and 24. $18=2\\cdot3^2$ and $24=2^3\\cdot3$, so the LCM of 18 and 24 is $2^3\\cdot3^2=72$. Therefore, an integer is a multiple of both 18 and 24 if and only if it is a multiple of 72.\n\nDividing 200 by 72 gives quotient 2 (and remainder 56), so there are 2 multiples of 72 less than 200.\n\nDividing 200 by 18 gives quotient 11 (and remainder 2), so there are 11 multiples of 18 less than 200.\n\nDividing 200 by 24 gives quotient 8 (and remainder 8), so there are 8 multiples of 24 less than 200.\n\nTherefore, Billy and Bobbi together can pick $11\\cdot8=88$ different two-number combinations, and 2 of these involve them choosing the same number (the two multiples of 72 are the possible duplicate numbers). Thus, the probability that they selected the same number is $2/88=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{44}}$."}
{"problem": "Emily ordered her playing cards by suit in the order $$A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A,2,3,\\cdots.$$What is the $42$nd card?", "solution": "There are $13$ cards in the pattern from $A$ to $K$. When you divide $42$ by $13$, you get $3$ with a remainder of $3$. Therefore, the $42^\\text{nd}$ card is a $\\boxed{3}$."}

{"problem": "The members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation. When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?", "solution": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members."}

Note that $12$ rows of $3$ chairs is different from $3$ rows of $12$ chairs.", "solution": "We are counting the number of ways 36 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers such that one of the numbers is not 1. Factoring 36, we find that $36=2^2\\cdot3^2$. The possible values for the number of rows is 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 (notice that we cannot have 1 row). Each value corresponds to a unique arrangement of the chairs. Thus, there are $\\boxed{7}$ possible arrays."}
{"problem": "How many positive integers, not exceeding 100, are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4?", "solution": "The multiples of 2 from 1 to 100 are $2, 4, 6,\\ldots, 100$.  There are 50 such numbers.\n\nThe multiples of 3 from 1 to 100 are $3, 6, 9,\\ldots, 99$.  There are 33 such numbers.\n\nThese lists count all of the multiples of 6 twice.  The multiples of 6 are $6, 12,\\ldots,96$, and there are 16 such multiples of 6.  Therefore there are $50+33-16=67$ multiples of 2 or 3 from 1 to 100.\n\nAll of the 25 multiples of 4 from 1 to 100 are on this list.  Therefore there are $67-25=\\boxed{42}$ numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4."}
{"problem": "What is the units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 10 and 110?", "solution": "Any odd multiple of 5 will end in a units digit of 5 (even multiples will end in a units digit of 0). Since all the integers we are multiplying are odd and some of them have a factor of 5, the product will be an odd multiple of 5 with a units digit of $\\boxed{5}$."}

Then $10n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$.  This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$.  The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\\boxed{6}$."}
{"problem": "What is the greatest multiple of 3 that is less than 500 and is also a multiple of 4?", "solution": "Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, the problem amounts to finding the greatest multiple of $3\\cdot4=12$ less than 500. Since $500\\div12=41R8$, our answer is $12\\cdot41=\\boxed{492}$."}
{"problem": "How many positive two-digit integers leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8?", "solution": "Our goal is to count the two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ for integer values of $n$.  We examine the inequality, $$ 10 \\le 8n + 2 < 100. $$Subtracting 2 from all parts simplifies things: $$ 8 \\le 8n < 98. $$Dividing everything by 8 isolates the possible values of $n$: $$ 1 \\le n < 12\\, \\frac{1}{4}. $$Since $n$ can be any integer from 1 to 12, there are $\\boxed{12}$ two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ (that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8)."}
{"problem": "Each row of a seating arrangement seats 7 or 8 people. Forty-six people are to be seated. How many rows seat exactly 8 people if every seat is occupied?", "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of rows with 8 people.  If we removed a person from each of these rows, then every row would contain 7 people.  Therefore, $46 - x$ must be divisible by 7.\n\nThen $x \\equiv 46 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.  The first few positive integers that satisfy this congruence are 4, 11, 18, and so on.  However, each row contains at least 7 people.  If there were 7 or more rows, then there would be at least $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ people.  We only have 46 people, so there must be at most six rows.  Therefore, the number of rows with 8 people is $\\boxed{4}$."}
{"problem": "Cameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them.  How many integers are in Cameron's list?", "solution": "A perfect square that is a multiple of $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1$ must be a multiple of $2^2 \\cdot 5^2 = 100$.  A perfect cube that is a multiple of 20 must be a multiple of $2^3 \\cdot 5^3 = 1000$.  Our goal is thus to count the multiples of 20 from 100 to 1000 inclusive: $$ 100 \\le 20n \\le 1000. $$Dividing this entire inequality by 20 we get $5 \\le n \\le 50$, so there are $50 - 5 + 1 = \\boxed{46}$ integers in Cameron's list."}

Since $72=6\\cdot12$, the 72nd bead will blue (the final bead to complete a pattern). The 73rd will be red, so the 74th will be $\\boxed{\\text{orange}}$."}
{"problem": "How many positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5?", "solution": "Every even multiple of 5 has a units digit of 0 and every odd multiple of 5 has a units digit of 5. There are $100/5=20$ positive multiples of 5 less than or equal to 100. One half of them, $20/2=10$, are odd multiples of 5. Therefore, $\\boxed{10}$ positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5."}
{"problem": "Find the largest integer less than 74 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7.", "solution": "We can use the Division Theorem ($a=bq+r$).  $74 \\div 7 = 10 R 4$, so $74 = 10 \\times 7 + 4$.  We subtract 1 to get a remainder of 3, so 74 - 1 = $\\boxed{73}$ is the answer."}
{"problem": "How many numbers from $1$ to $150$ are not perfect squares or perfect cubes?", "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $150$ is $12^2=144$. Therefore, there are $12$ perfect squares between $1$ and $150$.\n\nThe largest perfect cube less than $150$ is $5^3=125$. Therefore, there are $5$ perfect cubes between $1$ and $150$.\n\nHowever, there are numbers between $1$ and $150$ that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it must be a 6th power. The largest sixth power less than $150$ is $2^6=64$. Therefore, there are $2$ sixth powers between $1$ and $150$. Those two numbers are counted twice, so we have to subtract $2$ from the number of numbers that are a perfect square or perfect cube.\n\nTherefore, there are $12+5-2=15$ numbers that are either a perfect square or perfect cube. Therefore, there are $150-15= \\boxed{135}$ numbers that are neither a perfect square or a perfect cube."}
{"problem": "Let $a_n$ be the number obtained by writing the integers 1 to $n$ from left to right. Therefore, $a_4 = 1234$ and \\[a_{12} = 123456789101112.\\]For $1 \\le k \\le 100$, how many $a_k$ are divisible by 9?", "solution": "Let $f(n)$ be the sum of the digits of $n$. It turns out that $n-f(n)$ is always divisible by 9. As a proof, write $n = a_k10^k + a_{k-1}10^{k-1}+ \\cdots + a_{1}10^1 + a_0$. Therefore, $n - f(n) = a_k(10^k - 1) + a_{k-1}(10^{k-1} - 1) + \\cdots + a_2(10^2-1) + a_1(10-1)$. Note that, in general, $10^n - 1$ is divisible by 9 because $10^n-1$ is actually a string of $n$ 9's. Therefore, we can factor a 9 out of the right-hand side, so $n-f(n)$ is always divisible by 9. Note furthermore that $n-f(n)$ is always nonnegative, and that $f(n)$ and $n$ share the same remainder when divided by 9 (these are corollaries, the first coming from observation, the second being a direct result of the proof).\n\nNow, consider $f(a_n)$, which is divisible by 9 if and only if $a_n$ is. We have $f(a_n) = f(1) + f(2) + \\cdots + f(n-1) + f(n)$. Since $f(k)$ and $k$ have the same remainder when divided by 9, so we can substitute $k$ for $f(k)$ in each term without changing the remainder when divided by 9. Therefore, $f(a_k) \\equiv \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\pmod 9$, which implies that we need either $k$ or $k+1$ to be divisible by 9. This happens either when $k$ is a multiple of 9 or when $k$ is one less than a multiple of 9. There are 11 multiples of 9 less than or equal to 100, and since 100 is not a multiple of 9, there are also 11 numbers which are one less than a multiple of 9 between 1 and 100. Therefore, there are $11 + 11 = \\boxed{22}$ values of $a_k$ that are divisible by 9 for $1 \\le k \\le 100$."}
