{"problem": "The first and thirteenth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 5 and 29, respectively. What is the fiftieth term?", "solution": "Let $d$ be the common difference in this arithmetic sequence.  Then the $13^{\\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 12d = 29$.  Solving for $d$, we find $d = 2$.  Then the $50^{\\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 49 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{103}$."}
{"problem": "In the line $4x+7y+c=0$, the sum of the $x$- and $y$- intercepts is $22$. Find $c$.", "solution": "The $x$-intercept occurs when $y=0$. Plugging in we have $4x+7(0)+c=0$, so $4x=-c$ and $x=-\\frac{c}{4}$. The $y$-intercept occurs when $x=0$, so we plug in to find $4(0)+7y+c=0$, so $7y=-c$ and $y=-\\frac{c}{7}$. We are given that $\\left(-\\frac{c}{4}\\right)+\\left(-\\frac{c}{7}\\right)=22$. We solve for $c$ by multiplying through by a common denominator, which is $28$. This gives $7(-c)+4(-c)=22(28)$, so $-11c=22(28)$. Cancelling a factor of $11$ we have $-c=2(28)=56$, so $c=\\boxed{-56}$."}
{"problem": "Addison's age is three times Brenda's age. Janet is six years older than Brenda. Addison and Janet are twins. How old is Brenda?", "solution": "First, let $A = $ Addison's age, $B = $ Brenda's age, and $J = $ Janet's age. Then, from the statements given, we have the following system of equations:  $$\\begin{cases}\nA=3B \\\\\nJ = B+6 \\\\\nA=J\n\\end{cases} $$ Since $A=J$, we know that $3B=B+6$. Solving this equation, we have that $2B = 6 \\Rightarrow B=3$. Thus, Brenda is $\\boxed{3}$ years old."}
{"problem": "I had been planning to work for 20 hours a week for 12 weeks this summer to earn $\\$3000$ to buy a used car. Unfortunately, I got sick for the first two weeks of the summer and didn't work any hours. How many hours a week will I have to work for the rest of the summer if I still want to buy the car?", "solution": "If the total amount that I earn for the summer is constant, then the number of hours I work each week and the total number of weeks that I work are inversely proportional. Consequently, if I only work $\\frac{10}{12}=\\frac56$ as many weeks, I need to work $\\frac{6}{5}$ as many hours each week. $\\frac{6}{5}\\cdot20=24$, so I need to work $\\boxed{24}$ hours a week."}
{"problem": "A non-square rectangle has integer dimensions. The number  of square units in its area is numerically equal to the number of units in its perimeter. What is the number of units in the perimeter of this rectangle?", "solution": "Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$.  The problem is now telling us $ab=2a+2b$.  Putting everything on one side of the equation, we have $ab-2a-2b=0.$  This looks tricky.  However, we can add a number to both sides of the equation to make it factor nicely.  4 works here:  $$ab-2a-2b+4=4 \\Rightarrow (a-2)(b-2)=4$$Since we don't have a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different.  It doesn't matter which one is which, so we can just say $a=6 $ and $b=3 $.  The perimeter is then $2(6+3)=\\boxed{18}$"}

Express your answer as an ordered pair.", "solution": "$\\emph{Solution 1: Find the equation of the line.}$\n\nA point-slope equation of the line is $y-0= -2(x-5),$ so the standard form of the equation of the line is $2x+y=10.$ When $x=0,$ we have $y=10,$ so the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{(0,10)}.$\n\n$\\emph{Solution 2: Use the slope without finding the equation.}$\n\nBecause the slope of the line is $-2,$ the line goes down $2$ steps for each $1$ step right. However, the point we are given on the line, $(5,0),$ is already to the right of the $y$-axis, which is where the $y$-intercept is.Therefore, we instead think of the slope as going up $2$ steps for each $1$ step left. We must take $1$ step left $5$ times to get to the $y$-axis from point $(5,0),$ so to stay on this line, we must also take $2$ steps up $5$ times, for a total of $10$ steps.

Therefore\n\n\\[\\frac{f(6) - f(2)}{6-2} = \\frac{f(12) - f(2)}{12 - 2},\\]so \\[\\frac{12}{4} =\\frac{f(12) - f(2)}{10},\\]and $f(12) - f(2) = \\boxed{30}$."}
{"problem": "What is the slope of a line parallel to the line $2x - 4y = 9$? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "solution": "The slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is $y = m x + b$ where $m$ is the slope.  So if we get $y$ on the opposite side from $x$ and make it have a coefficient of 1, the slope of the line will be the coefficient of $x$.  Thus we add $4y$ to both sides and divide everything by 4 which makes the coefficient of $x$ equal to $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."}

What is the value of $m+b$?", "solution": "Since both of these points lie on the line, plugging them into the equation of the line will produce a true statement.  Thus $(-2, 0)$ gives us $0 = -2m + b$ and $(0, 2)$ gives us $2 = b$.  So we now know what $b$ is and can plug it back into the first equation to get $0 = -2m + 2$.

The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B.
