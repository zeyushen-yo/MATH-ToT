First, count all the possible words with the first two letters as \"BA\". These words are of the form \"BA _\", where the last letter can be either \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\". Thus, the number of such words is:\n   \\[\n   3\n   \\]\n   The possible words are \"BAA\", \"BAB\", and \"BAC\".\n\n3. **Position of \"BAB\":**\n\n   Within the words starting with \"BA\", \"BAB\" is the second word (as \"BAA\" is the first, \"BAB\" is the second, and \"BAC\" is the third).\n\n4. **Calculate the position of \"BAB\":**\n\n   Since there are 9 words that start with \"A\", the words starting with \"BA\" will follow the initial 9 words. Therefore, the position of \"BAB\" is:\n   \\[\n   9 + 2 = 11\n   \\]\n\nAnswer: 11",

                    "There are \\(3\\) choices for each letter in the word. So, the total number of words that start with 'A' is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\nNext, we count the number of words that start with 'BA'. There are \\(3\\) choices for the third letter, so the total number of words that start with 'BA' is \\(3\\).\n\nThus, the position of 'BAB' can be found by adding the number of words that start with 'A' to the number of words that precede 'BAB' in the 'BA*' sequence:\n\n\\[ 9 \\text{ (words starting with 'A') } + 1 \\text{ (the first word starting with 'BA', which is 'BAA') } = 10. \\]\n\nTherefore, the word 'BAB' is the next word after 'BAA', so it is the 11th word.\n\nAnswer: 11",
                    "To solve the problem, we will count the positions of words based on their starting letters alphabetically.\n\n1. **Count words starting with 'A':**\n   - Words starting with 'A' can be formed as 'AA_', 'AB_', or 'AC_', where the underscore can be filled with any of the letters 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n   - For each of 'AA', 'AB', and 'AC', there are 3 possibilities for the third letter ('A', 'B', or 'C'), resulting in \\(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\) words starting with 'A'.\n\n2. **Count words starting with 'B':**\n   - Words starting with 'B' can be formed as 'BA_', 'BB_', or 'BC_'.\n\n3. **Count words starting with 'BA':**\n   - Words starting with 'BA' can be formed as 'BAA', 'BAB', or 'BAC'.\n   - The word 'BAB' is the second word in this list.\n\nNow, combine these counts to determine the position of 'BAB':\n- There are 9 words starting with 'A'.\n- The first word starting with 'B' is word 10.\n- 'BAB' is the second word starting with 'BA'.\n\nTherefore, 'BAB' is word number \\(10 + 2 = 12\\).\n\nAnswer: 12",

There are 3 choices for the third letter, giving us \\(3\\) words starting with 'BA'.\n\nThe words starting with 'A' are numbered 1 to 9. The words starting with 'B' begin from 10. Therefore, the words starting with 'BA' are numbered from 10, 11, and 12. The word 'BAB' will be the 2nd word among those starting with 'BA'.\n\nAnswer: 11",
                    "First, we count the number of words that start with the letter 'A'. Since each word is three letters long and each letter can be 'A', 'B', or 'C', the number of words starting with 'A' is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nThese words are: AAA, AAB, AAC, ABA, ABB, ABC, ACA, ACB, ACC, which are Words 1 to 9.\n\nNext, we count the number of words that start with 'B'. Similarly, the number of words starting with 'B' is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nThese words are: BAA, BAB, BAC, BBA, BBB, BBC, BCA, BCB, BCC.\n\nNow, we only need to count the words that appear before 'BAB' among those starting with 'B'. The words starting with 'BA' are:\n\n1. BAA\n2. BAB\n\nTherefore, 'BAB' is the second word in this group. Since the words starting with 'A' take up positions 1 to 9, the words starting with 'B' begin at position 10.\n\nThus, the position of 'BAB' is:\n\n\\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \\]\n\nAnswer: 12",
                    "First, calculate the number of words that start with the letter 'A'. \n\nEach word starting with 'A' can have any combination of 'A', 'B', or 'C' for the second and third letters:\n\n- The second letter choices for 'A' are: 'A', 'B', 'C'.\n- The third letter choices for each of these are also: 'A', 'B', 'C'.\n\nHence, the number of words starting with 'A' is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\nNext, calculate the number of words that start with 'BA'. \n\nFor words starting with 'BA', the third letter can be 'A', 'B', or 'C'. Thus, there are 3 words: 'BAA', 'BAB', 'BAC'.\n\nNow that we know:\n\n- Words starting with 'A': 9 words.\n- Words starting with 'BA': 3 words.\n\nThe position of 'BAB' is:\n\n- After all words starting with 'A': 9 words.\n- The first word starting with 'BA' is 'BAA', the second is 'BAB'.\n\nTherefore, 'BAB' is the 9 (words starting with 'A') + 1 (for 'BAA') + 1 (for 'BAB') = 11th word.\n\nAnswer: 11"
