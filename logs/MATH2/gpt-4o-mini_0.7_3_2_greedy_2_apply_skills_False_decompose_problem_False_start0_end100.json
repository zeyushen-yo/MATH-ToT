            "Possible next step: Calculate the total area of the garden and then subtract the total area of the two smaller square plots to find the area of the walkways. \n\nFirst, find the area of the garden using the side length calculated: \nArea of the garden = side length \u00d7 side length = 16 feet \u00d7 16 feet = 256 square feet.\n\nNext, calculate the area of the two smaller square plots:\nArea of one plot = 4 feet \u00d7 4 feet = 16 square feet.\nArea of two plots = 2 \u00d7 16 square feet = 32 square feet.\n\nNow, subtract the area of the plots from the area of the garden to find the area of the walkways:\nArea of the walkways = Area of the garden - Area of the plots = 256 square feet - 32 square feet = 224 square feet.\n\nNow, let's summarize this calculation:\n\nArea of the walkways = 224 square feet.\n\nNow I can provide the answer. \n\nAnswer: 224 square feet."
