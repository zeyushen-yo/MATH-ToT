            "To solve the original problem, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that:\n\n1. \\( k^3 - k \\) is divisible by both \\( 9 \\) and \\( 10 \\).\n2. The sum of digits of \\( k \\) is a prime number.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Divisibility Conditions\n\nThe expression \\( k^3 - k \\) can be factored as \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\), which represents the product of three consecutive integers. \n\n#### Divisibility by 9\nFor \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\) to be divisible by \\( 9 \\), at least one of these three consecutive integers must be divisible by \\( 9 \\). This implies:\n- \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 4 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9} \\)\n\nSince it must be divisible by 9, at least one of these residues must specifically be \\( 0 \\).\n\n#### Divisibility by 10\nFor \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\) to be divisible by \\( 10 \\), one of these integers must be divisible by \\( 2 \\) and one must be divisible by \\( 5 \\). Consecutive numbers always include an even number, so divisibility by \\( 2 \\) is naturally satisfied. Thus, we need:\n- \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Finding Common Solutions\n\nWe need \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\) and \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we combine these conditions to get:\n- \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{45} \\)\n\nThis means \\( k \\) must be a multiple of \\( 45 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Checking Digit Sum

Since each bead is 0.5 units in length, the total length of a 6-bead bracelet is 3 units, which is already an integer. Therefore, the focus is on determining how many distinct sequences of 6 beads can be formed from the infinite sequence.\n\n### Steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Bead Pattern**:\n   - The sequence of bead colors is cyclic: red, blue, green.\n   - The number of beads in each color section follows powers of 2:\n     - 2 red beads\n     - 4 blue beads\n     - 8 green beads\n     - 16 red beads\n     - and so on.\n\n2. **Identify Color Distribution in 6 Beads**:\n   - A sequence of 6 beads will always complete exactly 2 full cycles (as 6 mod 3 = 0).\n   - Each cycle of 3 beads contains exactly one red, one blue, and one green bead.\n   - Therefore, any sequence of 6 beads will have:\n     - 2 red beads,\n     - 2 blue beads,\n     - 2 green beads.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Distinct Sequences**:\n   - We need to determine the number of ways to arrange 6 beads with the condition that 2 are red, 2 are blue, and 2 are green.\n   - This is a combinatorial problem where we calculate the number of permutations of a multiset.\n\n   The formula for permutations of a multiset is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times n_3!}\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the total number of elements, and \\( n_1, n_2, n_3 \\) are the counts of each indistinguishable item.\n\n   Applying this to our case:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{720}{8} = 90\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of different bracelets of 6 beads with an integer perimeter value is \\( \\boxed{90} \\).",
            "To solve the original problem, we need to find how many different bracelets of 6 beads can be made such that the total perimeter is an integer value. Given that each bead is 0.5 units long, the total length of 6 beads is 3 units, and thus the perimeter, which is formed by joining the ends of the sequence to make a bracelet, is an integer.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**:\n   - The bead colors follow the pattern: red, blue, green.\n   - The number of beads in each color section follows powers of 2:\n     - 1st red section: 2 beads\n     - 1st blue section: 4 beads\n     - 1st green section: 8 beads\n     - 2nd red section: 16 beads\n     - and so on.\n\n2. **Determine the Color Composition of 6 Beads**:\n   - Since each complete cycle involves 3 beads (one red, one blue, one green), and 6 beads will complete exactly 2 full cycles, the color distribution in any sequence of 6 beads will be 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green beads.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Distinct Sequences**:\n   - The problem of arranging 6 beads with 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green is a permutation problem of a multiset.\n   - The number of permutations is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{720}{8} = 90\n     \\]\n\n4. **Bracelet Consideration**:\n   - A bracelet is a circular arrangement, so we must account for rotations being identical.\n   - For a bracelet of 6 beads, there are 6 possible rotations for each linear sequence.\n   - Therefore, the total number of distinct bracelets is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{90}{6} = 15\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of different bracelets that can be made is \\( \\boxed{15} \\).",

The problem asks for sequences where the perimeter of the bracelet is an integer, which is inherently satisfied since 6 beads * 0.5 units/bead = 3 units is already an integer.\n\n3. **Color Distribution in 6 Beads**:\n   We need to determine how the 6 beads can be selected in terms of their colors. Since the sequence follows a cyclic RGB pattern with increasing powers of 2, the selection of beads will depend on which sections of the pattern the 6 beads are drawn from.\n\n4. **Analyze the Cycle Contribution**:\n   Given the repeating pattern and the powers of 2 structure, any sequence of 6 beads could fall across different sections and cycles. However, due to the repeating RGB pattern, any set of 6 beads will contain a mixture of the three colors, which we need to calculate.\n\n5. **Count Possible Sequences**:\n   We must determine how many sequences of 6 beads can be formed, considering the pattern of the beads and the constraints.\n\n   - Each complete cycle of 3 beads contains exactly one red, one blue, and one green bead. The number of beads in each section doubles every cycle, but since we only need 6 beads, the overlap and choice are limited.\n   \n   - We need to distribute 6 beads among red, blue, and green while respecting the pattern. Since the number of beads in each section is a power of 2 and much larger than 6 after the first few sections, we essentially have enough beads from any section to use in our sequence.\n\n   - The sequence of 6 beads can be arranged in permutations considering the color distribution.\n\n6. **Compute Total Sequences**:\n   Using the formula for permutations of a multiset, considering equal distribution is not strictly required due to the pattern (e.g., 2 red, 2 blue, 2 green is a common distribution):\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{720}{8} = 90\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of different bracelets of 6 beads that can be made while ensuring the perimeter is an integer is \\( \\boxed{90} \\).",

This is a permutations of a multiset problem.\n\n   The formula for permutations of a multiset is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times \\ldots \\times n_k!}\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the total number of elements, and \\( n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k \\) are the counts of each indistinguishable item.\n\n   For our case:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{720}{8} = 90\n   \\]\n\n5. **Account for Rotational Symmetry**:\n   A bracelet can be rotated, which means some arrangements that look different linearly are identical when formed into a circular bracelet. To account for this, we divide by the number of positions the bracelet can be rotated. For 6 beads, this is 6 rotations.\n\n   Therefore, the number of distinct bracelets is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{90}{6} = 15\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of different bracelets that can be made is \\( \\boxed{15} \\).",
            "To solve the original problem, we need to consider the pattern of bead colors and lengths, and ensure the bracelet made with 6 beads has an integer perimeter.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Pattern**:\n   - The pattern of bead colors is red, blue, green, repeating indefinitely.\n   - The number of beads in each color section follows powers of 2:\n     - 2 red beads, 4 blue beads, 8 green beads, 16 red beads, 32 blue beads, 64 green beads, and so on.\n\n2. **Determine Possible Selections**:\n   - A bracelet is made of 6 beads.\n   - Each bead has a length of 0.5 units, so the total length of the bracelet is 3 units.\n\n3. **Color Distribution**:\n   - We need to find how many different combinations of these colors can form a bracelet of 6 beads.\n   - Since the pattern repeats every 3 sections (red, blue, green), and the total number of beads required is 6, we will complete exactly two full cycles of the pattern.\n\n4. **Calculate the Distribution**:\n   - For any complete cycle of 3 beads, there is 1 red, 1 blue, and 1 green bead.\n   - For 6 beads, therefore, we will have:\n     - 2 red beads,\n     - 2 blue beads,\n     - 2 green beads.\n\n5. **Compute Different Arrangements**:\n   - We need to compute the number of ways to arrange 6 beads where 2 are red, 2 are blue, and 2 are green.\n   - This is a permutation problem of a multiset.\n\n6. **Use the Permutation Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{720}{8} = 90\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of different bracelets that can be made with 6 beads, ensuring the total length is exactly 3 units, is \\( \\boxed{90} \\).",

Since each bead has a fixed length, the perimeter will always be 3 units (6 x 0.5 = 3), regardless of the bead selection. Therefore, we focus on the distinct sequences of beads.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**:\n   The pattern of bead colors is red, blue, green, repeating indefinitely.\n   - The number of beads in each section follows the powers of 2:\n     - Red beads: \\(2, 16, 64, 256, \\ldots\\)\n     - Blue beads: \\(4, 32, 128, 512, \\ldots\\)\n     - Green beads: \\(8, 64, 256, 1024, \\ldots\\)\n\n2. **Understand the Sequence**:\n   We need to consider the sequence of beads in this pattern. The crucial point is that the sequence is infinite and each section doubles the number of beads from the previous cycle.\n\n3. **Determine Color Distribution**:\n   Since the pattern repeats every three sections (one cycle of red, blue, and green), and each color section's bead count is a power of 2, any continuous selection of 6 beads will likely cross sections but will maintain a color composition proportionate to the cycle.\n\n4. **Calculate the Distribution in 6 Beads**:\n   Over the infinite series, a selection of 6 beads will typically cover a portion of each color, given the large numbers of beads in each section. However, any valid sequence of 6 beads can mix colors, as long as they fit the infinite pattern.\n\n5. **Compute Total Permutations**:\n   If we assume a typical distribution based on the repeating pattern:\n   - 6 beads can be arranged in combinations of 3 colors: red, blue, and green.\n\n   Given the infinite nature and consistent repetition of the pattern, any continuous sequence of 6 beads will always be a combination involving these three colors. Each sequence will be a permutation of the color arrangement.\n\n   The number of permutations for a sequence of 6 beads consisting of two of each color (assuming a typical spread where all colors are represented equally) is given by the formula for permutations of a multiset:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{720}{8} = 90\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of different bracelets that can be made, given the constraints and infinite repetition, is \\( \\boxed{90} \\).",

Given that each bead is 0.5 units in length, a bracelet consisting of 6 beads will automatically have a total length of 3 units, which is already an integer. Therefore, the length condition is always satisfied, and we only need to focus on the sequence of beads.\n\nLet's break down the bead sequence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: \n   - The pattern of bead colors is red, blue, green, repeating indefinitely.\n   - The number of beads in each color section follows powers of 2:\n     - 2 red beads\n     - 4 blue beads\n     - 8 green beads\n     - 16 red beads\n     - 32 blue beads\n     - 64 green beads\n     - and so on...\n\n2. **Determine Color Contribution in 6 Beads**:\n   - We need to find how 6 beads can be selected from this infinite series, taking into account the cyclic pattern and increasing bead counts.\n   - The cycle of colors (red, blue, green) repeats every 3 colors, and each color section doubles in size with each cycle.\n\n3. **Calculate Possible Sequences**:\n   - Given that the bead sequence is infinite, any selection of 6 beads will have a color composition that depends on the sequence structure.\n   - Each complete cycle of 3 beads contains one red, one blue, and one green bead. However, the number of beads in each section increases as powers of 2.\n   - For a bracelet, the order of beads matters, but since it is circular, rotations of the same sequence count as the same bracelet.\n\n4. **Color Distribution in 6 Beads**:\n   - As the beads can be selected across cycles, consider the combinations that can occur such that we pick 6 beads.\n   - The typical distribution for 6 beads could involve beads from different color sections, but for simplicity, consider a uniform distribution: 2 beads from each color (this matches the pattern repetition).\n\n5. **Compute Total Unique Bracelets**:\n   - To calculate the number of unique bracelets, consider permutations of 6 beads where 2 are red, 2 are blue, and 2 are green, but account for the circular nature.\n   - The number of distinct linear arrangements of these beads is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{720}{8} = 90\n     \\]\n   - For a bracelet, which is a circular permutation, divide by 6 (due to rotational symmetry):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{90}{6} = 15\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of different bracelets that can be made with exactly 6 beads, ensuring the perimeter is an integer value, is \\( \\boxed{15} \\).",

Since 3 units is already an integer, any combination of 6 beads will satisfy the length condition.\n\n3. **Determine Bead Selection Possibilities**:\n   Since the sequence of beads is infinite and the pattern is cyclic, we need to consider how the beads can be selected from the infinite sequence. Given the nature of the problem, the infinite series of beads means we can choose any 6 consecutive beads, keeping in mind the color pattern and the power of 2 distribution for each color.\n\n4. **Color Distribution in 6 Beads**:\n   We need to check the possible color combinations within any 6 consecutive beads, considering the power of 2 distribution:\n   - Since the color pattern repeats every 3 sections (red, blue, green) and the number of beads doubles every cycle, we can conclude that any continuous selection of 6 beads will usually cut across these color sections.\n\n5. **Compute Total Possible Bracelets**:\n   To find the number of different bracelets, we need to figure out how many distinct sequences of 6 beads can be generated. This is a combinatorial problem involving the arrangement of the beads.\n\n   Since the total number of beads in any 6-bead segment can be assumed to include all colors due to the infinite pattern, we can use the same multiset permutation formula:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times n_3!}\n   \\]\n   where \\( n_1, n_2, n_3 \\) represent the counts of each color (red, blue, green).

The amount of sugar needed per cake is \\( \\frac{1}{11} \\) kg, so we can make\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10 \\text{ kg}}{\\frac{1}{11} \\text{ kg/cake}} = 10 \\times 11 = 110 \\text{ cakes}\n     \\]\n     So, we can make a maximum of 110 cakes based on the sugar available.\n   \n   - **Eggs:** We have 20 kg of eggs. The amount of eggs needed per cake is \\( \\frac{7}{11} \\) kg, so we can make\n     \\[\n     \\frac{20 \\text{ kg}}{\\frac{7}{11} \\text{ kg/cake}} = \\frac{20 \\times 11}{7} \\approx 31.43 \\text{ cakes}\n     \\]\n     So, we can make a maximum of 31 cakes based on the eggs available.\n\n3. **Determine the Limiting Ingredient:**\n   The number of cakes we can make is limited by the ingredient that runs out first. From our calculations:\n   - Flour allows for 146 cakes\n   - Sugar allows for 110 cakes\n   - Eggs allow for 31 cakes\n\n   Therefore, eggs are the limiting ingredient, and we can make a maximum of 31 cakes with the given supplies.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The maximum number of 1 kg cakes that can be made with the given quantities of ingredients is 31.\n\nAnswer: 31",

Therefore, we can make a maximum of 13 cakes based on the flour available.\n\n   - **Sugar:** We have 10 kg of sugar. Since each cake requires 1 kg of sugar, we can make \\( \\frac{10 \\text{ kg}}{1 \\text{ kg/cake}} = 10 \\) cakes.\n\n   - **Eggs:** We have 20 kg of eggs. Since each cake requires 7 kg of eggs, we can make \\( \\frac{20 \\text{ kg}}{7 \\text{ kg/cake}} \\approx 2.86 \\) cakes. Therefore, we can make a maximum of 2 cakes based on the eggs available.\n\n3. **Determine the Limiting Ingredient:**\n   The number of cakes we can make is limited by the ingredient that runs out first. From our calculations:\n   - Flour allows for 13 cakes\n   - Sugar allows for 10 cakes\n   - Eggs allow for only 2 cakes\n\n   Thus, eggs are the limiting ingredient, and we can make a maximum of 2 cakes with the given supplies.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The maximum number of 1 kg cakes that can be made with the given quantities of ingredients is 2.\n\nAnswer: 2",

We are interested in the upper arc, where \\( b \\geq 4.5 \\).\n\n   The angle \\(\\theta\\) from the positive x-axis to the points of intersection can be found using the cosine function:\n\n   \\[\n   \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{9} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   This gives \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\n\n   Since the circle is symmetric about the x-axis, the total angle subtended by the arc where \\( b \\geq 4.5 \\) is:\n\n   \\[\n   2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the probability:**\n\n   The total circumference of the circle is \\(2\\pi \\times 9 = 18\\pi\\).\n\n   The arc length where \\( b \\geq 4.5 \\) corresponds to an angle of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\).\n\n   The length of this arc is:\n\n   \\[\n   9 \\times \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = 6\\pi\n   \\]\n\n   The probability that a randomly selected point on the circle has a product of modulus and imaginary part at least 40.5 is the ratio of the arc length where \\( b \\geq 4.5 \\) to the total circumference:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6\\pi}{18\\pi} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the product of the modulus and the imaginary part of a randomly selected point on the circle is at least 40.5 is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\\)."

            "To solve the original problem, we need to find the number of 3-digit numbers \\(abc\\) such that \\(1 \\leq a < b < c \\leq 9\\) and ensure that the product \\((a-1)(b-1)(c-1)\\) is not zero.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Identify the Condition**: The digits \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) must satisfy \\(1 \\leq a < b < c \\leq 9\\). This means each digit must be distinct and arranged in increasing order.\n\n2. **Exclude Invalid Cases**: Since the product \\((a-1)(b-1)(c-1)\\) must not be zero, none of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), or \\(c\\) can be 1. This is because if any one of these digits is 1, one of the factors \\((a-1)\\), \\((b-1)\\), or \\((c-1)\\) will be zero, making the product zero.\n\n3. **Adjust the Range of Digits**: Since \\(a\\) cannot be 1, the smallest value \\(a\\) can take is 2. Consequently, the digits \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) can only be chosen from the set \\(\\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Valid Sequences**: We need to count the number of strictly increasing sequences of three digits from the set \\(\\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\).

This means none of \\(a-1\\), \\(b-1\\), or \\(c-1\\) can be zero, implying \\(a > 1\\).\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Identify the Set**: The digits \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) must satisfy \\(1 \\leq a < b < c \\leq 9\\). Since \\(a > 1\\) to ensure \\((a-1) \\neq 0\\), the smallest possible value for \\(a\\) is 2.

This happens if any of \\(a, b, c\\) equals 1 (since \\(a-1 = 0\\) in this case).

The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi (3)^2 (4) = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 4 = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic feet}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Target Volume\n\nThe problem states that we want the volume to double. Thus, the target volume is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 36\\pi = 72\\pi \\text{ cubic feet}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Infinite Geometric Series\n\nThe series has a first term \\( r_1 = 9 \\) and a second term \\( r_2 = 6 \\). To find the common ratio \\( r \\), we solve:\n\n\\[\nr_1 \\cdot r = 6 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r_1 = 9\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9r = 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Sum of the Infinite Geometric Series\n\nThe formula for the sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series with first term \\( a \\) and common ratio \\( r \\) (where \\( |r| < 1 \\)) is:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values \\( a = 9 \\) and \\( r = \\frac{2}{3} \\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{9}{1 - \\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{9}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 9 \\times 3 = 27\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Number of Full Minutes Required to Double the Volume\n\nInitially, the tank contains \\( 36\\pi \\) cubic feet of water. We need to add enough water to reach \\( 72\\pi \\) cubic feet. The total additional volume needed is:\n\n\\[\n72\\pi - 36\\pi = 36\\pi\n\\]\n\nWe need the sum of the water pumped in the sequence to equal \\( 36\\pi \\). The infinite series sums to 27 cubic feet, which is less than 36 cubic feet. Therefore, we need to calculate the finite sum up to a certain minute \\( t \\) where the sum approaches \\( 36\\pi \\).\n\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of the series is given by:\n\n\\[\nS_n = 9 \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n}{1 - \\frac{2}{3}} = 27 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n\\right)\n\\]\n\nWe want:\n\n\\[\n27 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n\\right) = 36\n\\]\n\nSolving:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n = \\frac{36}{27} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this equation is incorrect since \\( 1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n \\) cannot exceed 1. Thus, we must find the largest \\( n \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n27 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n\\right) \\approx 36\n\\]\n\nThis equation does not hold true, which means the sum of the series can never reach \\( 36\\pi \\) cubic feet. Therefore, it's impossible for the volume to double under the given conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe solution concludes that it is impossible for the sum of the series to equal or exceed the additional \\( 36\\pi \\) cubic feet needed to double the volume.

            "To solve the given problem, we need to find the sum of the first four terms of a geometric sequence where the first term \\(a\\) and the common ratio \\(r\\) are determined as follows:\n\n1. **Find the first term \\(a\\):**  \n   The first term \\(a\\) is the sum of the roots of the equation \\(x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0\\). \n   To find the roots, use the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -2\\), and \\(c = -8\\). Therefore, the roots are:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-8)}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 32}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{36}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm 6}{2}\n   \\]\n   The roots are \\(x_1 = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\\) and \\(x_2 = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2\\).

The area of the original triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a right triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the original triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{leg}_1 \\times \\text{leg}_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 \\times 80 = 2400 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nWe also know that the area of a right triangle can be calculated using the base and height (altitude to the hypotenuse):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{hypotenuse} \\times \\text{altitude}\n\\]\n\nSolving for the altitude:\n\n\\[\n2400 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 \\times \\text{altitude}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{altitude} = \\frac{2400 \\times 2}{100} = 48 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the length of the path (altitude) is 48 feet, we determine the number of lights needed:\n\n- Divide the total length of the path by the spacing between lights:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of lights} = \\frac{48}{5} = 9.6\n  \\]\n\n- Since we can't have a fraction of a light, we round up to the nearest whole number, hence we need 10 lights.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the combined area of the two smaller triangles.\n\nThe altitude divides the original triangle into two smaller triangles, each using the altitude as one side, and part of the hypotenuse as another side. However, since we already calculated the original triangle's area as 2400 square feet, and the altitude divides it into two smaller triangles, their combined area is also 2400 square feet.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total cost.\n\nThe total cost is the sum of the number of lights and the area of the triangles:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Number of lights} + \\text{Combined area of smaller triangles}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 10 + 2400 = 2410\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost is 2410.\n\nAnswer: 2410",

            "To solve the problem of finding the expected location that the teacher stands at when the gold medals are placed such that no two are adjacent, we can follow a similar approach to the example provided.\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n\n1. **Positions Available**: 12 positions (1 to 12).\n2. **Gold Medals**: 5 gold medals.\n3. **Non-adjacency Constraint**: No two gold medals can be placed in adjacent positions.\n\n### Steps to Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Placement Strategy\n- Place the 7 silver medals ('S') first. This creates 8 potential gaps (including ends) to place the gold medals ('G').\n\nFor example, placing the 7 silver medals might look like this:\n\\[ S \\_ S \\_ S \\_ S \\_ S \\_ S \\_ S \\_ S \\]\n\nThe underscores represent potential spots for placing gold medals. There are 8 gaps available for placing the 5 gold medals.\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate Possible Configurations\n- Choose 5 out of these 8 gaps to place the gold medals. This can be done in:\n  \\[\n  \\binom{8}{5} = 56\n  \\]\n  ways.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine Positions of Gaps\n- Each gap corresponds to positions in the sequence. The positions for the gaps are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Expected Positions\n- Each of these positions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15) can be occupied by a gold medal, and each position will appear in:\n  \\[\n  \\binom{7}{4} = 35\n  \\]\n  ways (choosing 4 other positions out of the remaining 7).\n\n#### Step 5: Calculate Total Sum of Positions\n- The sum of the positions is:\n  \\[\n  1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64\n  \\]\n\n- The total sum of all positions for all configurations is:\n  \\[\n  35 \\times 64 = 2240\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 6: Expected Average Position\n- The expected average position of the gold medals is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2240}{56 \\times 5} = \\frac{2240}{280} = 8\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe expected average position of the gold medals, and therefore the expected location that the teacher stands at, is **8**.\n\nAnswer: 8",
            "To solve the original problem, we need to calculate the expected average position of 5 gold medals placed in a sequence of 12 positions with the restriction that no two gold medals are adjacent.

The number of ways to choose 5 positions from 8 is:\n\\[ \\binom{8}{5} = 56 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculating Expected Value\n\n1. **Each Position's Contribution**: Each position (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15) will appear in:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{7}{4} = 35 \\text{ times (since choosing 4 other positions out of the remaining 7)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Sum**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total sum of positions} = 35 \\times (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 35 \\times 64 = 2240\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Expected Average Position**:\n   The expected average position of the gold medals is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average position} = \\frac{\\text{Total sum of positions}}{\\text{Total number of ways} \\times 5} = \\frac{2240}{280} = 8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected average position of the gold medals is **8**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe expected location that the teacher stands at is **8**. \n\nAnswer: 8",

Each position (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15) will appear in:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{7}{4} = 35 \\text{ times (since choosing 4 other positions out of the remaining 7)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Sum**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total sum of positions} = 35 \\times (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 35 \\times 64 = 2240\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Expected Average Position**:\n   The expected average position of the gold medals is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average position} = \\frac{\\text{Total sum of positions}}{\\text{Total number of ways} \\times 5} = \\frac{2240}{56 \\times 5} = \\frac{2240}{280} = 8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected average position of the gold medals is **8**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe expected location that the teacher stands at, which is the average position of the gold medals, is 8.\n\nAnswer: 8"

Set up the proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{714}{x}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   5x = 2 \\times 714\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5x = 1428\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1428}{5} = 285.6\n   \\]\n\nThus, 285.6 grams of water are needed, which rounds to 286 grams when rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Dough Weight\nThe total weight of the dough is the sum of the flour and water:\n\\[\n\\text{Total dough weight} = 714 \\, \\text{grams (flour)} + 286 \\, \\text{grams (water)} = 1000 \\, \\text{grams}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine How Many 45-Gram Pieces Can Be Made\nWe need to determine how many 45-gram pieces can be made from the total dough weight.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of 45-gram pieces:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of 45-gram pieces} = \\frac{1000}{45} \\approx 22.2222\n   \\]\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a piece, you can make 22 full 45-gram pieces.\n\n### Step 4: Determine How Many 23-Gram Pieces Can Be Made\nNow, we need to find out how many 23-gram pieces can be made with the remaining dough.\n\n1. **Calculate the leftover dough after making 45-gram pieces:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Leftover dough} = 1000 - (22 \\times 45) = 1000 - 990 = 10 \\, \\text{grams}\n   \\]\n\nThis leftover is not enough to make an additional 23-gram piece.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of dough pieces that can be made, considering the initial division into 45-gram pieces, is 22. Since the leftover dough is insufficient for another 23-gram piece, the total remains 22.\n\nThus, the maximum number of dough pieces that can be made is **22 pieces**.\n\nAnswer: 22 pieces"

            "To solve the original problem, we need to follow a systematic approach similar to the example. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Step 1: List all possible combinations of sides\n\nEach side of the original triangle (9 cm, 40 cm, 41 cm) can be either 1 cm too long or 1 cm too short. This provides us with three possible lengths for each side:\n\n- First side (originally 9 cm): 8 cm, 9 cm, 10 cm\n- Second side (originally 40 cm): 39 cm, 40 cm, 41 cm\n- Third side (originally 41 cm): 40 cm, 41 cm, 42 cm\n\nThis results in \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\) possible combinations of side lengths.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the triangle inequality\n\nFor each combination \\((a, b, c)\\), we need to check if they satisfy the triangle inequality:\n\n- \\(a + b > c\\)\n- \\(a + c > b\\)\n- \\(b + c > a\\)\n\n### Step 3: Exclude the congruent triangle\n\nWe need to exclude any triangle that is congruent to the original triangle with sides 9 cm, 40 cm, and 41 cm. In this context, a triangle is congruent if it has the same three side lengths, possibly in a different order.\n\n### Step 4: Check each combination\n\nWe'll verify the triangle inequality for each valid combination. Here's how you can check:\n\n1. **Combination (8, 39, 40):**\n   - \\(8 + 39 = 47 > 40\\)\n   - \\(8 + 40 = 48 > 39\\)\n   - \\(39 + 40 = 79 > 8\\)\n   - Valid triangle\n\n2. **Combination (8, 39, 41):**\n   - \\(8 + 39 = 47 > 41\\)\n   - \\(8 + 41 = 49 > 39\\)\n   - \\(39 + 41 = 80 > 8\\)\n   - Valid triangle\n\n3. **Combination (8, 39, 42):**\n   - \\(8 + 39 = 47 > 42\\)\n   - \\(8 + 42 = 50 > 39\\)\n   - \\(39 + 42 = 81 > 8\\)\n   - Valid triangle\n\n4.

This results in:\n   \\[\n   -5 \\leq \\frac{n}{2} \\leq 10\n   \\]\n   Solving this inequality gives:\n   \\[\n   -10 \\leq n \\leq 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate \\( f(x) \\) at Key Points**: The minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) on \\([-5, 10]\\) could occur at \\( x = -5 \\), \\( x = 10 \\), or at the vertex \\( x = \\frac{n}{2} \\) if it lies within the interval.\n\n5. **Calculate \\( f(x) \\) at Endpoints**:\n   \\[\n   f(-5) = (-5)^2 - n(-5) + 240 = 25 + 5n + 240 = 5n + 265\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f(10) = (10)^2 - n(10) + 240 = 100 - 10n + 240 = 340 - 10n\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate \\( f(x) \\) at Vertex (if within interval)**:\n   \\[\n   f\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)^2 - n\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) + 240 = \\frac{n^2}{4} - \\frac{n^2}{2} + 240 = -\\frac{n^2}{4} + 240\n   \\]\n\n7. **Ensure Minimum Value is Non-negative**:\n   \\[\n   \\min\\left(5n + 265, 340 - 10n, -\\frac{n^2}{4} + 240\\right) \\geq 0\n   \\]\n\n8. **Analyze Inequalities**:\n   - \\( 5n + 265 \\geq 0 \\) implies \\( n \\geq -53 \\). This is always satisfied for \\( n \\geq -10 \\).\n   - \\( 340 - 10n \\geq 0 \\) implies \\( n \\leq 34 \\).\n   - \\(-\\frac{n^2}{4} + 240 \\geq 0\\) implies \\( n^2 \\leq 960 \\), or approximately \\( n \\leq 31 \\).\n\n9. **Find the Largest Possible \\( n \\)**: The most restrictive condition is \\( n \\leq 31 \\). Given the previous range \\( -10 \\leq n \\leq 20 \\), the largest integer \\( n \\) satisfying all the conditions is \\( n = 20 \\).\n\nTherefore, the largest integer \\( n \\) for which \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\([-5, 10]\\) is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."

Let's go through the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Components\n\n1. **Expression 1:** \\(\\left\\lceil{\\frac{k^2 - 4}{k - 2}}\\right\\rceil\\)\n\n   - When \\( k \\neq 2 \\), the expression simplifies to \\( k + 2 \\). \n   - When \\( k = 2 \\), the expression is undefined because it involves division by zero.\n\n2. **Expression 2:** \\(\\lfloor{\\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1}}\\rfloor\\)\n\n   We need to evaluate the floor function for this expression.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify Expressions\n\nFor \\( k \\neq 2 \\):\n\n- The expression simplifies to \\( k + 2 \\).\n- The equation becomes:\n\n  \\[\n  \\left\\lceil k + 2 \\right\\rceil + \\lfloor \\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1} \\rfloor = 5\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for Specific \\( k \\)\n\n#### Case 1: \\( k + 2 \\) is an integer\n\nSince \\( k + 2 \\) is an integer, \\(\\left\\lceil k + 2 \\right\\rceil = k + 2\\).\n\n\\[\nk + 2 + \\lfloor \\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1} \\rfloor = 5\n\\]\n\nSolving for the floor function:\n\n\\[\n\\lfloor \\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1} \\rfloor = 5 - (k + 2) = 3 - k\n\\]\n\nThe fraction simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1} = 2 + \\frac{1}{k + 1}\n\\]\n\nFor the floor of this expression to equal \\( 3 - k \\), we need:\n\n\\[\n2 \\leq 3 - k < 3 \\implies 1 \\leq k < 3\n\\]\n\nChecking integer values within this range:\n\n- \\( k = 1 \\): \n  - \\(\\frac{1^2 - 4}{1 - 2} = \\frac{-3}{-1} = 3\\), \\(\\lceil 3 \\rceil = 3\\)\n  - \\(\\frac{2 \\cdot 1 + 3}{1 + 1} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\\), \\(\\lfloor 2.5 \\rfloor = 2\\)\n  - Sum: \\( 3 + 2 = 5 \\) (satisfies equation)\n\n- \\( k = 2 \\): \n  - Undefined (excluded since it involves division by zero)\n\n- \\( k = 3 \\): \n  - \\(\\lfloor \\frac{2 \\cdot 3 + 3}{3 + 1} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{9}{4} \\rfloor = 2\\)\n  - \\(\\lceil 3 + 2 \\rceil = 5\\)\n  - Sum: \\( 5 + 2 = 7 \\) (does not satisfy equation)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the analysis, the integer \\( k = 1 \\) satisfies the equation. Thus, there is exactly one integer satisfying the condition.\n\n**Answer:** 1",
            "To solve the problem, we need to determine the integer values of \\( k \\) for which the equation\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lceil{\\frac{k^2 - 4}{k - 2}}\\right\\rceil + \\lfloor{\\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1}}\\rfloor = 5\n\\]\n\nis satisfied. We will approach this step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the expressions\n\n1. **Simplify \\(\\frac{k^2 - 4}{k - 2}\\)**\n   - Note that \\(k^2 - 4\\) can be factored as \\((k-2)(k+2)\\).\n   - So, \\(\\frac{k^2 - 4}{k - 2} = \\frac{(k-2)(k+2)}{k-2} = k+2\\), provided \\(k \\neq 2\\).\n\n2. **Simplify \\(\\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1}\\)**\n   - This does not simplify straightforwardly, so we will consider specific \\(k\\) values.\n\n### Step 2: Handle special cases\n\n- **Case \\(k = 2\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{k^2 - 4}{k - 2} = \\frac{2^2 - 4}{2 - 2} = \\frac{0}{0}\n  \\]\n\n  This is undefined, hence \\(k = 2\\) is not a valid solution.\n\n### Step 3: Consider integer values of \\(k\\) other than 2\n\nWe consider values of \\(k\\) where both expressions are defined and evaluate their combined conditions.\n\n- **Case \\(k = 3\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{k^2 - 4}{k - 2} = 3 + 2 = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\lceil 5 \\rceil = 5\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1} = \\frac{2 \\times 3 + 3}{3 + 1} = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\lfloor 2.25 \\rfloor = 2\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sum} = 5 + 2 = 7 \\neq 5\n  \\]\n\n- **Case \\(k = 1\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{k^2 - 4}{k - 2} = \\frac{1 - 4}{1 - 2} = \\frac{-3}{-1} = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\lceil 3 \\rceil = 3\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1} = \\frac{2 \\times 1 + 3}{1 + 1} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\lfloor 2.5 \\rfloor = 2\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sum} = 3 + 2 = 5\n  \\]\n\n  This satisfies the equation.\n\n- **Case \\(k = 0\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{k^2 - 4}{k - 2} = \\frac{0^2 - 4}{0 - 2} = \\frac{-4}{-2} = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\lceil 2 \\rceil = 2\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1} = \\frac{2 \\times 0 + 3}{0 + 1} = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\lfloor 3 \\rfloor = 3\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sum} = 2 + 3 = 5\n  \\]\n\n  This satisfies the equation.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe values of \\(k\\) that satisfy the equation are \\(k = 0\\) and \\(k = 1\\). Therefore, the number of integer solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } 2\n\\]"

For no two consecutive heads to appear:\n- If the first toss is a tail (T), the remaining \\(n-1\\) tosses must also satisfy the condition, contributing \\(p_{n-1}\\).\n- If the first toss is a head (H), the second toss must be a tail (T), and the remaining \\(n-2\\) tosses must satisfy the condition, contributing \\(p_{n-2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the recurrence relation for \\(p_n\\) is:\n\\[\np_n = p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}\n\\]\nThis is similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Initial Conditions**\n\nThe initial conditions are:\n- \\(p_1 = 2/2 = 1\\) (since no two consecutive heads means the single toss can be either H or T)\n- \\(p_2 = 3/4\\) (the sequences are HT, TH, and TT, but not HH)\n\n**Step 3: Recognize the Sequence**\n\nNotice that \\(p_n\\) follows the Fibonacci-like sequence but shifted by initial conditions:\n- \\(p_1 = 1\\)\n- \\(p_2 = 2\\) (not 3/4, corrected as per the recurrence relation)\n- \\(p_3 = 3\\)\n- \\(p_4 = 5\\), and so on.\n\nThus, \\(p_n\\) corresponds to the Fibonacci numbers shifted by one index: \\(p_n = F_{n+1}\\), where \\(F_n\\) is the Fibonacci sequence starting with \\(F_1 = 1\\), \\(F_2 = 1\\).\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Series**\n\nNow, we compute the series:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+1}}{2^n}\n\\]\n\nThis series is similar to the example problem, but instead of \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+2}}{2^n}\\), we have \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+1}}{2^n}\\).\n\nUsing the generating function for Fibonacci numbers:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_n}{x^n} = \\frac{x}{1-x-x^2}\n\\]\n\nEvaluate it at \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_n}{2^n} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1-\\frac{1}{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 2\n\\]\n\nOur series is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+1}}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_n}{2^{n-1}} = 2 \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_n}{2^n}\n\\]\n\nFrom the generating function:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_n}{2^n} = 2 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+1}}{2^n} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe value of the infinite series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n}\\) is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
            "To solve the problem, we need to find the sum \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n}\\), where \\(p_n\\) is the probability that no two consecutive heads appear in the first \\(n\\) tosses of a fair coin.\n\nLet's approach this step by step:\n\n1. **Define the Problem Recursively:**\n   \n   Let \\(a_n\\) be the number of sequences of length \\(n\\) that do not contain consecutive heads. Clearly:\n   - \\(a_1 = 2\\) (the sequences are H and T).\n   - \\(a_2 = 3\\) (the sequences are HT, TH, TT).\n\n   For \\(n \\geq 3\\), consider the last toss:\n   - If it is a tail (T), then the first \\(n-1\\) tosses can be any valid sequence of length \\(n-1\\).\n   - If it is a head (H), the \\((n-1)\\)-th toss must be a tail (T), so the first \\(n-2\\) tosses can be any valid sequence of length \\(n-2\\). \n\n   Therefore, the recurrence relation is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\n   \\]\n\n   This is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, except for different initial conditions.\n\n2. **Initial Conditions and Relation to \\(p_n\\):**\n\n   The total number of sequences of length \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\), since each toss is either H or T.\n\n   The probability \\(p_n\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   p_n = \\frac{a_n}{2^n}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Few Initial Probabilities:**\n\n   - \\(a_1 = 2\\), so \\(p_1 = \\frac{2}{2^1} = 1\\).\n   - \\(a_2 = 3\\), so \\(p_2 = \\frac{3}{2^2} = \\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\n4. **Express the Problem as a Series:**\n\n   We need to find:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{p_n}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{2^{2n}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Generating Function Approach:**\n\n   Introduce the generating function for \\(a_n\\):\n   \\[\n   A(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n\n   \\]\n\n   From the recurrence relation, we have:\n   \\[\n   A(x) = 2 + 2x + \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty a_n x^n = 2 + xA(x) + x^2A(x)\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for \\(A(x)\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   A(x) = \\frac{2 + 2x}{1 - x - x^2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Substitute for the Probability Series:**\n\n   We are interested in:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{2^{2n}} = A\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) - 2\n   \\]\n\n   Plug \\(x = \\frac{1}{4}\\) into \\(A(x)\\):\n   \\[\n   A\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{2 + \\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2} = \\frac{2.5}{1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{16}} = \\frac{2.5}{\\frac{11}{16}} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 16}{11} = \\frac{40}{11}\n   \\]\n\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{p_n}{2^n} = \\frac{40}{11} - 2 = \\frac{40}{11} - \\frac{22}{11} = \\frac{18}{11}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: \\(\\frac{18}{11}\\)",
