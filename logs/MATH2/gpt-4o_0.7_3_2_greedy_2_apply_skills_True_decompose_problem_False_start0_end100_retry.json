Burnside's Lemma considers the number of fixed configurations under rotations.

Each bead has a length of 0.5 units, so a bracelet made of 6 beads will have a total length of \\(6 \\times 0.5 = 3\\) units. \n\nSince we need the perimeter to be an integer, we will consider the way the bracelet is joined, forming a loop. The perimeter of the bracelet is effectively determined by the number of unique arrangements of these sequences, considering rotational symmetry (since a bracelet is circular and rotations are equivalent).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct bracelets that can be formed, we need to consider the rotational equivalence of the sequences. This involves examining each sequence for distinct arrangements that are not simply rotations of one another.\n\nLet's start by considering the unique sequences and their rotational symmetries. For example, the sequence \"R R B B B B\" can be rotated to form several equivalent sequences: \"R B B B B R\", \"B B B B R R\", \"B B B R R B\", etc. We need to identify unique sequences considering such rotations.\n\nWe'll analyze each sequence:\n\n1. \"R R B B B B\": This sequence can form 3 unique bracelets due to its symmetry (rotations that result in the same sequence).\n2. \"R B B B B G\": This sequence has no repeated colors in a row, so all rotations are unique.\n3. \"B B B B G G\": This sequence can form 2 unique bracelets because of the two identical colors (G G) at the end.\n4. \"B B B G G G\": This sequence can form 2 unique bracelets because of the three identical colors (G G G).\n5. \"B B G G G G\": This sequence can form 3 unique bracelets due to its symmetry.\n6. \"B G G G G G\": This sequence has no repeated colors in a row, so all rotations are unique.\n\nNext, we will count all the unique sequences considering these rotational symmetries and check that the sum of their lengths remains 3 units, which is already guaranteed by construction. \n\nFinally, we will sum up the number of unique sequences to determine the total number of distinct bracelets that satisfy the condition.",

Therefore, any point \\( P \\) on the semicircle has a distance exactly equal to \\( r \\) from \\( M \\). Since the problem asks for the probability that this distance is greater than \\( r \\), and no such points exist on the semicircle, the probability is 0%.

Calculate the total number of ways to choose any two patches from the 63 patches. This can be done using combinations: \\( \\binom{63}{2} = \\frac{63 \\times 62}{2} = 1953 \\).\n\n2. Next, calculate the number of ways to choose two adjacent patches. There are two types of adjacency: side-by-side and corner-to-corner.\n\n   - Side-by-side adjacency can occur either horizontally or vertically:\n     - Horizontally adjacent patches: There are 9 rows and each row has 8 pairs of adjacent patches, giving \\( 9 \\times 8 = 72 \\) pairs.\n     - Vertically adjacent patches: There are 7 columns and each column has 8 pairs of adjacent patches, giving \\( 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\) pairs.\n\n   - Corner-to-corner adjacency occurs when patches touch at a corner:\n     - For a grid of 9x7, each internal 2x2 sub-square provides 4 corner-to-corner pairs. The number of such sub-squares is \\( 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\), giving \\( 48 \\times 4 = 192 \\) corner-to-corner pairs.\n  \n3. Add the adjacent pairs: \\( 72 + 56 + 192 = 320 \\).\n\n4. Subtract the number of adjacent pairs from the total number of pairs to get the number of ways to select non-adjacent patches: \\( 1953 - 320 = 1633 \\).\n\nThus, there are 1633 ways to plant the patches so that they both thrive.\n\nAnswer: 1633",
                    "Possible next step: Determine how two patches can be selected such that they do not touch each other. Two patches touch if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\nTo calculate the number of ways to select two non-touching patches, first calculate the total number of ways to select any two patches from the 63 patches, which is given by the combination \\( \\binom{63}{2} \\).\n\nNext, calculate the number of ways to select two patches that do touch each other:\n\n1. Horizontally touching patches: There are \\( 9 \\) rows and each row has \\( 8 \\) pairs of horizontally touching patches, resulting in \\( 9 \\times 8 = 72 \\) pairs.\n2. Vertically touching patches: There are \\( 7 \\) columns and each column has \\( 8 \\) pairs of vertically touching patches, resulting in \\( 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\) pairs.\n3. Diagonally touching patches: There are two types of diagonal touching:\n   - From top-left to bottom-right diagonal: There are \\( 8 \\) such diagonals, and each diagonal in the middle has several pairs. Calculating these involves carefully counting each diagonal.\n   - From top-right to bottom-left diagonal: Similar to the above, count each diagonal.\n\nThe sum of these numbers gives the total number of touching patch pairs. Subtract this from the total combinations to get the number of ways to select two patches that do not touch each other.",

Since the patches should not touch each other by the side or by the corner, find the total number of ways to select two non-adjacent patches from the grid of 63 patches. \n\nTo do this, start by selecting any patch for the roses (63 options). Then, exclude any patches that are adjacent (by side or corner) to the chosen patch for selecting the mint patch. Calculate the remaining non-adjacent patches available for the mint patch. Repeat this process for each initial choice of the rose patch and sum up all the valid configurations. \n\nThis step involves some combinatorial counting and spatial reasoning within the grid to ensure non-adjacency.",

The sum of the coefficients is \\(a + b + c = 1 - 15 + 56 = 42\\).\n\nSince the problem asks for how many choices of the coefficients \\((a + b + c)\\) are consistent with the given information, and we have found only one equation that meets the criteria, there is only one choice.\n\nAnswer: 1"

Calculate the area of each smaller triangle and sum them to confirm they equal 2400 square feet.\n\nFinally, add the number of lights to the total area to get the sum required for the total cost.\n\nPerform these calculations to verify and complete the solution:\n\n1. Top triangle area: \\(\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 \\times 48\\)\n2. Bottom triangle area: \\(\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 \\times 48\\)\n\nSum these areas and add the number of lights to find the total cost.",

Divide the total budget by the cost per card to find the maximum number of cards (guests) that can be afforded:\n\n\\[ 300 \\, \\text{cents} \\div 5 \\, \\text{cents per card} = 60 \\, \\text{cards} \\]\n\nNow, compare this number to the number of available prime numbers. There are 20 prime numbers between 50 and 150, which is less than the budget allows for. Thus, the maximum number of guests that can be invited is limited by the number of available unique prime numbers.\n\nAnswer: 20"
