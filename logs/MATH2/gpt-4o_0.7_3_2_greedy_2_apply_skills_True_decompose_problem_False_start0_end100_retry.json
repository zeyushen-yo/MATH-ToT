Using the formula for permutations of a multiset, we have 3! / (2!) = 3 permutations.\n\nNow, summing up the permutations for each combination gives us g(11, 3):\n\ng(11, 3) = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nAnswer: 6"

            "Your current step has correctly identified the valid combinations of prime numbers that sum to 11, which are (2, 2, 7) and (3, 3, 5). The next step involves calculating the permutations of these combinations to account for the distinct boxes.\n\nFor the combination (2, 2, 7):\n- Since there are two identical numbers (2, 2), the number of distinct permutations is calculated by dividing the factorial of the number of items by the factorial of the number of repetitions:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3!}{2!} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n  \\]\n  The possible permutations are: (2, 2, 7), (2, 7, 2), and (7, 2, 2).\n\nFor the combination (3, 3, 5):\n- Similar to the above, with two identical numbers (3, 3), the number of distinct permutations is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3!}{2!} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n  \\]\n  The possible permutations are: (3, 3, 5), (3, 5, 3), and (5, 3, 3).\n\nAdding the permutations from both combinations gives us the total number of ways to distribute the items:\n- 3 (from 2, 2, 7) + 3 (from 3, 3, 5) = 6\n\nAnswer: 6"
