We must identify combinations of 6 beads that are rotationally unique and check if their sequence can form a bracelet of exactly 3 units in perimeter.\n\nFirst, let's assess possible starting positions and sequences from the series. Since we are looking for a sequence that starts with a red bead and follows the pattern of doubling, we can calculate the sections:\n\n1.
