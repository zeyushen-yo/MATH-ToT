Hence, the next step will be to calculate the total number of ways to start the game (which is 10, one for each friend) and determine the successful outcomes where the ball returns to the starting person after 9 passes. \n\nIn conclusion, the probability is \\( \\frac{10}{10} = 1 \\), meaning the ball will always return to the starting person after 9 passes.",

We then observe that if the ball starts with a person, it will move through a predictable sequence based on the number of passes. For example, if the ball starts with person A, the sequence of ball holders after each pass will be:\n\n1. Pass 1: A \u2192 B\n2. Pass 2: B \u2192 C\n3. Pass 3: C \u2192 D\n4. Pass 4: D \u2192 E\n5.

It becomes evident that for the ball to return to the starting person after 9 passes, we must consider the modular arithmetic of circular arrangements. \n\nTo summarize, the next concrete action is to compute these sequences for all starting positions and determine how many of them lead back to the original person after 9 passes. This will help us identify the favorable outcomes to calculate the probability effectively.",

Therefore, we can analyze the passing pattern and identify the required conditions for the ball to return to the starting person after exactly 9 passes. We will explore how many different positions the ball can occupy at each pass and how they relate to the starting position. \n\nNext, we can calculate the possible passing sequences that lead back to the starting position after 9 passes.
