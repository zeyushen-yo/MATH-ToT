However, 0 is not a prime number, so this distribution is not valid.\n\n2. **Using 7**:\n   - If one box contains 7 items, the remaining 4 items must be distributed into the other two boxes, each containing a prime number of items.\n   - The possible prime partitions of 4 are (3, 1), but 1 is not a prime number, so this distribution is not valid.\n\n3. **Using 5**:\n   - If one box contains 5 items, the remaining 6 items must be distributed into the other two boxes, each containing a prime number of items.\n   - The possible prime partitions of 6 are (3, 3). This is valid, so one distribution is (5, 3, 3).\n\n4. **Using 3**:\n   - If one box contains 3 items, the remaining 8 items must be distributed into the other two boxes, each containing a prime number of items.\n   - The possible prime partitions of 8 are (5, 3).

The distribution (2, 7, 2) can be arranged in 3 ways: (2, 7, 2), (7, 2, 2), and (2, 2, 7).\n\nThus, the total number of distinct distributions is 3 (for 5, 3, 3) + 3 (for 3, 5, 3) + 3 (for 2, 7, 2) = 9.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 9"

The initial amount is 0.5 liters, and the series can be described as:\n\\[\na_n = 0.5 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^n\n\\]\n\nThe limit of this series as \\( n \\to \\infty \\) is:\n\\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = \\frac{0.5}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount of water in the container approaches 1 liter as time goes on.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the amount of water is never in the interval \\([n, n+1]\\). Since the amount of water approaches 1 liter, it will never reach or exceed 2 liters.

The modulus of \\( z \\) is 9 (since \\( z \\) is on the circle), so the condition becomes:\n   \\[\n   9 \\cdot |b| \\geq 40.5\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this inequality gives:\n   \\[\n   |b| \\geq \\frac{40.5}{9} = 4.5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Geometric Interpretation**: The condition \\( |b| \\geq 4.5 \\) means that the imaginary part \\( b \\) of the point \\( z \\) must be either greater than or equal to 4.5 or less than or equal to -4.5. \n\n4. **Circle Symmetry**: The circle is symmetric about the real axis.

The circle's equation is \\( a^2 + b^2 = 81 \\). For \\( b = 4.5 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + (4.5)^2 = 81 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a^2 + 20.25 = 81 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a^2 = 60.75\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a = \\pm \\sqrt{60.75}\n   \\]\n\n   Similarly, for \\( b = -4.5 \\), the same calculation holds, giving the same \\( a \\) values.\n\n6. **Calculating the Angle**: The angle \\( \\theta \\) corresponding to \\( b = 4.5 \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sin \\theta = \\frac{4.5}{9} = 0.5\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\) (30 degrees).\n\n   Similarly, for \\( b = -4.5 \\), the angle is \\( \\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\).\n\n7. **Total Arc Length**: The total arc length where \\( |b| \\geq 4.5 \\) is the sum of the arcs from \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\) to \\( \\theta = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} \\) and from \\( \\theta = -\\frac{5\\pi}{6} \\) to \\( \\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\).\n\n   Each arc is \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\) radians long, so the total arc length is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Probability Calculation**: The total circumference of the circle is \\( 2\\pi \\times 9 = 18\\pi \\).

            "To solve the problem of finding the remainder when \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{49} (4n)!\\) is divided by 105, we start by analyzing the divisors of 105. The number 105 can be factored as:\n\n\\[\n105 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\n\\]\n\nWe will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which requires us to find the remainder of the sum modulo 3, 5, and 7 separately.\n\n### Modulo 3\n\nFor \\(n \\geq 1\\), \\(4n \\geq 4\\), and thus \\((4n)!\\) contains the factor 3. Therefore, for each \\(n\\), \\((4n)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\). Consequently, the entire sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{49} (4n)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\n### Modulo 5\n\nSimilarly, for \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\(4n \\geq 8\\), and thus \\((4n)!\\) contains the factor 5. Therefore, for \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\((4n)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}\\). The only term that needs checking is \\(n = 1\\), where \\(4n = 4\\), so:\n\n\\[\n4! = 24 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum modulo 5 is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{49} (4n)! \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\n\n### Modulo 7\n\nFor \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\(4n \\geq 8\\), and thus \\((4n)!\\) contains the factor 7. Therefore, for \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\((4n)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}\\). The only term that needs checking is \\(n = 1\\), where \\(4n = 4\\), so:\n\n\\[\n4! = 24 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum modulo 7 is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{49} (4n)! \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\n### Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem\n\nWe have the following system of congruences:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nx &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\\\\nx &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo solve this, we first find \\(x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\\) and \\(x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\\). Using the method of successive substitutions:\n\n1. Solve \\(x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\\) and \\(x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\\).\n\n   Assume \\(x = 5k + 4\\). Then:\n\n   \\[\n   5k + 4 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\implies 5k \\equiv -1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}\n   \\]\n\n   The inverse of 5 modulo 7 is 3 (since \\(5 \\times 3 = 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\\)), so:\n\n   \\[\n   k \\equiv 6 \\times 3 \\equiv 18 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, \\(k = 7m + 4\\), and substituting back:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 5(7m + 4) + 4 = 35m + 20 + 4 = 35m + 24\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, \\(x \\equiv 24 \\pmod{35}\\).\n\n2. Solve \\(x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\) and \\(x \\equiv 24 \\pmod{35}\\).\n\n   Assume \\(x = 35n + 24\\). Then:\n\n   \\[\n   35n + 24 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\implies 2n + 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\implies 2n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\n   \\]\n\n   Since 2 is invertible modulo 3, \\(n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\). Thus, \\(n = 3p\\), and substituting back:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 35(3p) + 24 = 105p + 24\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, \\(x \\equiv 24 \\pmod{105}\\).\n\nThus, the remainder when \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{49} (4n)!\\) is divided by 105 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]"

            "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes it will take for the volume of water in the tank to double, given that water is being pumped in according to a geometric series.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial volume of water in the tank. The tank is a right circular cylinder with a radius of 3 feet and a height of 4 feet. The volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi (3)^2 (4) = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic feet}\n\\]\n\nThe goal is to double this volume, so the final volume should be:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 36\\pi = 72\\pi \\text{ cubic feet}\n\\]\n\nThis means we need to add an additional \\( 36\\pi \\) cubic feet of water to the tank.\n\nNext, we analyze the series of water being pumped into the tank. The series is geometric with the first term \\( r_1 = 9 \\) and the second term \\( r_2 = 6 \\). The common ratio \\( r \\) of the series can be found by dividing the second term by the first term:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{r_2}{r_1} = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe series of water volumes pumped into the tank is:\n\n\\[\nr_1, r_2, r_3, \\ldots = 9, 6, 6 \\times \\frac{2}{3}, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThe sum \\( S_n \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric series is given by:\n\n\\[\nS_n = r_1 \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the sum of the series is at least \\( 36\\pi \\).

When divided by 4, the remainder is 3.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the conditions\n\n- **Divisible by 5**: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5.\n- **Remainder 3 when divided by 4**: A number \\( n \\) gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 if \\( n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Find numbers divisible by 5 and check the remainder condition\n\nSince the number must be divisible by 5, it can be expressed in the form \\( n = 5k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nWe also need \\( n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\). Substituting \\( n = 5k \\) into this congruence, we have:\n\n\\[\n5k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nk \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 4m + 3 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the range for three-digit numbers\n\nA three-digit number ranges from 100 to 999. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n100 \\leq 5k \\leq 999\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( k = 4m + 3 \\) into the inequality:\n\n\\[\n100 \\leq 5(4m + 3) \\leq 999\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n100 \\leq 20m + 15 \\leq 999\n\\]\n\nSubtract 15 from all parts:\n\n\\[\n85 \\leq 20m \\leq 984\n\\]\n\nDivide the entire inequality by 20:\n\n\\[\n4.25 \\leq m \\leq 49.2\n\\]\n\nSince \\( m \\) must be an integer, the possible values for \\( m \\) are from 5 to 49.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of solutions\n\nThe integer values of \\( m \\) range from 5 to 49, inclusive. To find the number of integers in this range, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n49 - 5 + 1 = 45\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 45 three-digit positive integers that satisfy both conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of three-digit positive integers that are divisible by 5 and leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: 45}\n\\]"

Since the total parts are 5, each part weighs \\( \\frac{15 \\text{ kg}}{5} = 3 \\text{ kg}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the weight of each ingredient per set**:\n   - Flour: \\(2 \\times 3 \\text{ kg} = 6 \\text{ kg}\\)\n   - Sugar: \\(1 \\times 3 \\text{ kg} = 3 \\text{ kg}\\)\n   - Eggs: \\(2 \\times 3 \\text{ kg} = 6 \\text{ kg}\\)\n\n5. **Determine how many sets can be made from available ingredients**:\n   - Flour: \\( \\frac{40 \\text{ kg}}{6 \\text{ kg/set}} = 6.67 \\text{ sets}\\)\n   - Sugar: \\( \\frac{10 \\text{ kg}}{3 \\text{ kg/set}} = 3.33 \\text{ sets}\\)\n   - Eggs: \\( \\frac{20 \\text{ kg}}{6 \\text{ kg/set}} = 3.33 \\text{ sets}\\)\n\n6. **Find the limiting ingredient**: The limiting ingredient is the one that allows the fewest complete sets. Here, both sugar and eggs allow for 3.33 sets, which is the limiting factor.\n\n7. **Calculate the maximum number of complete cakes**: Since we can only make complete sets, we take the integer part of the limiting factor, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of cakes that can be made is 3.\n\nAnswer: 3"

            "To solve this problem, we need to address two main tasks: determining the number of lights needed along the path and calculating the combined area of the two smaller triangles formed by the path.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Length of the Path\nThe park is a right-angled triangle with sides 60 feet, 80 feet, and 100 feet. The path is constructed from the right angle (where the 60 feet and 80 feet sides meet) straight to the hypotenuse (100 feet side). This path is the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse.\n\nFor a right-angled triangle, the area can be calculated in two ways:\n1. Using the two legs: \\(\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 \\times 80 = 2400 \\text{ square feet}\\).\n2. Using the hypotenuse and the altitude (path): \\(\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 \\times \\text{altitude}\\).\n\nSetting these equal gives:\n\\[\n2400 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 \\times \\text{altitude}\n\\]\n\\[\n2400 = 50 \\times \\text{altitude}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{altitude} = \\frac{2400}{50} = 48 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Lights\nThe lights are placed 5 feet apart along the 48-foot path. The number of lights needed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of lights} = \\frac{48}{5} + 1 = 9.6 + 1 = 10.6\n\\]\nSince we can't have a fraction of a light, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 10 lights.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Combined Area of the Two Smaller Triangles\nThe path divides the original triangle into two smaller right-angled triangles. The area of the original triangle is 2400 square feet, and since the path is an altitude, it divides the triangle into two smaller triangles with the same total area as the original triangle.\n\nThus, the combined area of the two smaller triangles is:\n\\[\n\\text{Combined area} = 2400 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Cost\nThe total cost is the sum of the number of lights and the area of the triangles:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 10 \\text{ lights} + 2400 \\text{ square feet} = 2410\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: 2410}\n\\]"

The number of paths from (0,0) to (2,3) is C(5,2) = 10.\n   - From (2,3), the frog cannot proceed to (4,3) because it would have to cross the line x+y=5.\n\n6. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Since the only point on the line x+y=5 that the frog could potentially reach is (2,3), and it cannot proceed from there to (4,3), we only need to subtract the paths that reach (2,3).\n   - Therefore, the number of valid paths is 35 - 10 = 25.\n\nThus, the number of distinct paths the frog can take to reach (4,3) without crossing the line x+y=5 is:\n\nAnswer: 25"

The distance can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: \\(d = \\sqrt{(3t)^2 + (5t)^2} = \\sqrt{9t^2 + 25t^2} = \\sqrt{34t^2} = \\sqrt{34}t\\).\n   - Since the distance is not specified, we assume the retailer is at a fixed distance that each drone reaches in a certain time \\(t\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the time difference between the first and last drone:**\n   - The first drone starts at \\(t = 0\\).\n   - Each subsequent drone starts 2 minutes after the previous one.\n   - The 30th drone (last drone) starts at \\(t = 2 \\times (30 - 1) = 58\\) minutes.\n   - Therefore, the time difference between the first and last drone starting their journey is 58 minutes.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since all drones travel the same path and take the same time to reach the retailer, the time difference in their arrival is the same as the time difference in their starting times.\n\nThus, the time difference between the first and last drone to arrive at the retailer is 58 minutes.\n\nAnswer: 58"

            "To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation and inequality. We have:\n\n1. The equation: \\( |z|^2 + 2|z|x + x^2 = 100 \\).\n2. The inequality: \\( \\operatorname{Re}(z) > x \\).\n\nGiven that \\( z = a + bi \\), the modulus of \\( z \\) is \\( |z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + b^2) + 2\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}x + x^2 = 100.\n\\]\n\nLet \\( |z| = r \\). Then the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nr^2 + 2rx + x^2 = 100.\n\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n(r + x)^2 = 100.\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have:\n\n\\[\nr + x = 10 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad r + x = -10.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( r = |z| \\geq 0 \\), the case \\( r + x = -10 \\) would imply \\( r = -10 - x \\), which is not possible because \\( r \\) cannot be negative. Therefore, we only consider:\n\n\\[\nr + x = 10.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( r = 10 - x \\).\n\nNext, we use the inequality \\( \\operatorname{Re}(z) = a > x \\). Since \\( r = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 10 - x.\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = (10 - x)^2.\n\\]\n\nWe need \\( a > x \\). To maximize \\( x \\), we should minimize \\( a \\) while still satisfying \\( a > x \\). The smallest \\( a \\) can be is slightly more than \\( x \\), so we set \\( a = x + \\epsilon \\) where \\( \\epsilon \\) is a small positive number.\n\nSubstituting \\( a = x + \\epsilon \\) into the equation \\( a^2 + b^2 = (10 - x)^2 \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n(x + \\epsilon)^2 + b^2 = (10 - x)^2.\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 2x\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2 + b^2 = 100 - 20x + x^2.\n\\]\n\nCanceling \\( x^2 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2 + b^2 = 100 - 20x.\n\\]\n\nFor \\( \\epsilon \\to 0 \\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nb^2 = 100 - 20x.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( b^2 \\geq 0 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n100 - 20x \\geq 0.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n100 \\geq 20x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x \\leq 5.\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum integer value of \\( x \\) is 5. We verify that \\( x = 5 \\) satisfies the inequality \\( a > x \\) by choosing \\( a = 5 + \\epsilon \\) and checking that \\( b^2 = 0 \\) is possible, which it is when \\( \\epsilon \\) is small.\n\nTherefore, the maximum integer value that \\( x \\) can have is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: 5}\n\\]"

Each side can either be 1 cm too long or 1 cm too short, leading to the following possibilities for each side:\n\n- The side originally 9 cm can be 8 cm or 10 cm.\n- The side originally 40 cm can be 39 cm or 41 cm.\n- The side originally 41 cm can be 40 cm or 42 cm.\n\nWe need to determine how many distinct triangles can be formed with these variations, ensuring that none of the triangles are congruent to the original triangle or to each other.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible combinations of side lengths:\n\n1. (8, 39, 40)\n2. (8, 39, 42)\n3. (8, 41, 40)\n4. (8, 41, 42)\n5. (10, 39, 40)\n6. (10, 39, 42)\n7. (10, 41, 40)\n8. (10, 41, 42)\n\nNext, we need to check which of these combinations form valid triangles using the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\n1. (8, 39, 40): 8 + 39 > 40, 8 + 40 > 39, 39 + 40 > 8. This is a valid triangle.\n2. (8, 39, 42): 8 + 39 > 42, 8 + 42 > 39, 39 + 42 > 8. This is a valid triangle.\n3. (8, 41, 40): 8 + 41 > 40, 8 + 40 > 41, 41 + 40 > 8. This is not a valid triangle because 8 + 40 is not greater than 41.\n4. (8, 41, 42): 8 + 41 > 42, 8 + 42 > 41, 41 + 42 > 8.

Since all the side lengths are different from the original triangle, none of these are congruent to the original triangle.

We will find a recurrence relation for \\( a_n \\).\n\n- If the first toss is a tail (T), the remaining \\( n-1 \\) tosses can be any sequence of length \\( n-1 \\) with no two consecutive heads. There are \\( a_{n-1} \\) such sequences.\n- If the first toss is a head (H), the second toss must be a tail (T) to avoid consecutive heads. The remaining \\( n-2 \\) tosses can be any sequence of length \\( n-2 \\) with no two consecutive heads. There are \\( a_{n-2} \\) such sequences.\n\nThus, the recurrence relation is:\n\\[\na_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Initial Conditions\n\n- For \\( n = 1 \\), the sequences are \"H\" and \"T\". Only \"T\" satisfies the condition, so \\( a_1 = 2 \\).\n- For \\( n = 2 \\), the sequences are \"HH\", \"HT\", \"TH\", \"TT\". The valid sequences are \"HT\", \"TH\", and \"TT\", so \\( a_2 = 3 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Recurrence\n\nThe recurrence relation \\( a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} \\) with initial conditions \\( a_1 = 2 \\) and \\( a_2 = 3 \\) is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but shifted. The solution is:\n\\[\na_n = F_{n+2}\n\\]\nwhere \\( F_n \\) is the Fibonacci sequence with \\( F_1 = 1 \\), \\( F_2 = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \\( p_n \\)\n\nThe total number of sequences of length \\( n \\) is \\( 2^n \\).
