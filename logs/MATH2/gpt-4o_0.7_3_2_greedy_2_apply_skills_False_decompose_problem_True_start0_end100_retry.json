Since there are 10 friends, we can use modular arithmetic to calculate the final position of the ball relative to the starting position. Specifically, if the ball starts with person \\( i \\), after 9 passes, it will be with person \\( (i + 9) \\mod 10 \\).

To return to the starting person (person 1), we need the result to be 1.

Specifically, we need to find all contiguous sequences of 6 beads from the cumulative series of beads, ensuring the total length of the bracelet (3 units) results in an integer value for its perimeter. \n\n1. We have identified that the cumulative number of beads up to the first few sections is as follows:\n   - Cumulative total after first red section: 2 beads\n   - Cumulative total after first blue section: 6 beads\n   - Cumulative total after first green section: 14 beads\n\n2. The entire cycle thus far is 14 beads long. \n\n3. We need to identify the possible sequences of 6 contiguous beads within this 14-bead cycle. We will examine each starting position and ensure the sequence can wrap around if it extends beyond the 14th bead:\n\n   - Starting at position 1, the sequence is beads 1 to 6.\n   - Starting at position 2, the sequence is beads 2 to 7.\n   - ...\n   - Starting at position 9, the sequence is beads 9 to 14.\n   - Starting at position 10, the sequence wraps around and is beads 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 1.\n   - Continuing this pattern, we will examine all 14 starting possibilities.\n\n4.

Since the length of 6 beads results in a bracelet of 3 units, which is an integer, we focus on identifying each unique sequence as determined by the starting position.\n\n5. There should be 14 unique sequences possible as per this setup.\n\nAfter evaluating these sequences, we can then conclude how many distinct bracelets can be formed."

Let's compute this systematically using the sets \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\) that have been defined:\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Sum of Absolute Differences for Original Problem\n\nFirst, let's reiterate the sets:\n\n- \\( S_1 = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81, 85, 89, 93, 97\\} \\)\n- \\( S_2 = \\{3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71, 75, 79, 83, 87, 91, 95, 99\\} \\)\n\nBoth \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\) have 25 elements each.\n\n#### Calculate the sum of absolute differences for each \\( a \\in S_1 \\):\n\n1. For \\( a = 1 \\):\n   - Differences: \\( |1 - 3|, |1 - 7|, \\ldots, |1 - 99| \\)\n   - Sum = \\( 2 + 6 + 10 + \\ldots + 98 \\)\n\n2. For \\( a = 5 \\):\n   - Differences: \\( |5 - 3|, |5 - 7|, \\ldots, |5 - 99| \\)\n   - Sum = \\( 2 + 2 + 6 + \\ldots + 94 \\)\n\n3. Continue this for all \\( a \\) in \\( S_1 \\).\n\n#### Generalizing the Calculation:\n\nThe differences follow a consistent pattern due to the arithmetic progressions in both sets. We can use this to simplify the calculation:\n\n- For each \\( a_i = 4k + 1 \\) in \\( S_1 \\), and \\( b_j = 4m + 3 \\) in \\( S_2 \\), the difference is calculated as:\n  \\[\n  |(4k + 1) - (4m + 3)| = |4k - 4m - 2|\n  \\]\n  Which simplifies to \\( |2(k - m) - 2| \\).\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the sum of these differences over all pairs.\n\n#### Compute the Total Sum:\n\nGiven the symmetry and the linear spacing, the total sum can be calculated as the difference between the sum of elements in \\( S_2 \\) and the sum of elements in \\( S_1 \\) times the number of elements in each set.\n\n- Sum of elements in \\( S_1 \\):\n  \\[\n  \\sum_{k=0}^{24} (4k + 1) = 4 \\sum_{k=0}^{24} k + 25 = 4 \\cdot \\frac{24 \\cdot 25}{2} + 25 = 1200 + 25 = 1225\n  \\]\n\n- Sum of elements in \\( S_2 \\):\n  \\[\n  \\sum_{m=0}^{24} (4m + 3) = 4 \\sum_{m=0}^{24} m + 75 = 4 \\cdot \\frac{24 \\cdot 25}{2} + 75 = 1200 + 75 = 1275\n  \\]\n\n- Total sum of absolute differences:\n  \\[\n  25 \\times |1275 - 1225| = 25 \\times 50 = 1250\n  \\]\n\nThus, the sum of the absolute differences between all pairs \\( a, b \\) where \\( a \\) is an element in \\( S_1 \\) and \\( b \\) is an element in \\( S_2 \\) is \\(\\boxed{1250}\\).",
                    "Now that we have defined the sets \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\) for the original problem, the next step is to calculate the sum of the absolute differences between all pairs \\( (a, b) \\) where \\( a \\in S_1 \\) and \\( b \\in S_2 \\).\n\n### Calculate the Sum of Absolute Differences\n\nWe will compute the sum of \\( |a - b| \\) for each combination of \\( a \\) from \\( S_1 \\) and \\( b \\) from \\( S_2 \\). Here is the calculation:\n\n1. **Calculate the sum of absolute differences for each \\( a \\in S_1 \\):**\n\n   We will iterate through each element \\( a \\) in \\( S_1 \\) and compute \\( |a - b| \\) for each \\( b \\) in \\( S_2 \\), then sum these values.\n\n2. **Sum the results for all \\( a \\) in \\( S_1 \\).**\n\nLet's go ahead and perform these calculations.\n\n### Detailed Calculation\n\nFor each \\( a \\in S_1 \\), calculate the sum of \\( |a - b| \\) for all \\( b \\in S_2 \\).\n\n1. **For \\( a = 1 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   |1 - 3| &= 2, \\\\\n   |1 - 7| &= 6, \\\\\n   |1 - 11| &= 10, \\\\\n   &\\quad \\vdots \\\\\n   |1 - 99| &= 98.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n   Sum for \\( a = 1 \\).\n\n2. **For \\( a = 5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   |5 - 3| &= 2, \\\\\n   |5 - 7| &= 2, \\\\\n   |5 - 11| &= 6, \\\\\n   &\\quad \\vdots \\\\\n   |5 - 99| &= 94.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n   Sum for \\( a = 5 \\).\n\n3. **Continue this calculation for all \\( a \\) in \\( S_1 \\) up to \\( a = 97 \\).**\n\nAfter computing these sums for each \\( a \\), sum them all together to get the total sum of absolute differences.\n\n### Total Sum\n\nOnce all calculations are performed, sum up the individual results to find the total sum of absolute differences.\n\nThis step involves iterating and summing up values, which can be done programmatically or manually for each \\( a \\).\n\n**Perform these calculations to find the final result for the problem.**\n\nPossible next step: Calculate the sum of absolute differences for each element \\( a \\in S_1 \\) against all elements \\( b \\in S_2 \\), and then sum these results to find the final answer."
