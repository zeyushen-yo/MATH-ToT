            "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many different bracelets can be made from a sequence of 6 beads such that the total length of the bracelet is an integer value. Each bead has a length of 0.5 units, so the total length of the bracelet will be \\(6 \\times 0.5 = 3\\) units. Since the length is already an integer, we need to focus on the arrangement of the beads.\n\nThe sequence of beads follows a pattern based on powers of 2:\n\n- Red: 2, 16, 64, ...\n- Blue: 4, 32, 128, ...\n- Green: 8, 64, 256, ...\n\nThe sequence of colors is Red, Blue, Green, and repeats. The number of beads in each section increases as powers of 2, but since we are only interested in a sequence of 6 beads, we need to determine how these beads can be selected from the repeating pattern.\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. Red section: 2 beads\n2. Blue section: 4 beads\n3. Green section: 8 beads\n4. Red section: 16 beads\n5. Blue section: 32 beads\n6. Green section: 64 beads\n7. Red section: 128 beads\n8. Blue section: 256 beads\n9. Green section: 512 beads\n10. ...\n\nThe sequence of colors is R, B, G, R, B, G, R, B, G, ...\n\nTo form a bracelet, we need to select 6 consecutive beads. The possible sequences of colors for 6 beads are:\n\n1. R, B, G, R, B, G\n2. B, G, R, B, G, R\n3. G, R, B, G, R, B\n\nThese sequences repeat every 3 colors. Since the number of beads in each section is a power of 2, and the sequence of colors repeats every 3 colors, the number of different bracelets is determined by the number of unique sequences of 6 beads that can be formed.\n\nSince the sequence of colors repeats every 3 colors, and we are selecting 6 beads, the number of different bracelets is determined by the number of unique sequences of 6 beads that can be formed from the repeating pattern.\n\nTherefore, the number of different bracelets that can be made is 3.\n\nAnswer: 3"

            "To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the water volume in the container over time. Initially, the container has 500 mL of water. Every minute, the scientist adds water equal to half of the current amount. This forms a geometric series.\n\nLet's denote the amount of water in the container at the start as \\( a_0 = 500 \\) mL. At each minute \\( t \\), the amount of water added is half of the current amount. Therefore, the amount of water at minute \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ a_t = a_0 + \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\frac{a_0}{4} + \\cdots + \\frac{a_0}{2^t} \\]\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term \\( a_0 = 500 \\) and common ratio \\( r = \\frac{1}{2} \\). The sum of the first \\( t+1 \\) terms of this geometric series is:\n\n\\[ S_t = a_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{2^t}\\right) \\]\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{a_0}{1 - r} = \\frac{500}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 1000 \\]\n\nThus, as \\( t \\) approaches infinity, the total amount of water in the container approaches 1000 mL, or 1 liter.\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the amount of water in the container is never in the interval \\([n, n+1]\\) liters. Since the total amount of water approaches 1 liter, it will never reach or exceed 2 liters. Therefore, the interval \\([2, 3]\\) liters will never be reached.\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the amount of water is never in the interval \\([n, n+1]\\) is \\( n = 2 \\).\n\nAnswer: 2"

The difference \\( |(4k + 1) - (4m + 3)| = |4k - 4m - 2| = 4|k - m| - 2 \\).\n\nTo find the sum of all these differences, we note that for each \\( k \\), \\( a = 4k + 1 \\) and for each \\( m \\), \\( b = 4m + 3 \\), the difference is \\( 4(k - m) - 2 \\).\n\nThe number of elements in \\( S_1 \\) is 25 and the number of elements in \\( S_2 \\) is 25. Therefore, there are \\( 25 \\times 25 = 625 \\) pairs.\n\nFor each fixed \\( k \\), the sum of differences over all \\( m \\) is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{24} (4(k - m) - 2) = 4k \\times 25 - 4 \\sum_{m=0}^{24} m - 2 \\times 25\n\\]\n\nThe sum \\( \\sum_{m=0}^{24} m = \\frac{24 \\times 25}{2} = 300 \\).\n\nThus, the sum for each \\( k \\) is:\n\\[\n100k - 1200 - 50 = 100k - 1250\n\\]\n\nSumming over all \\( k \\) from 0 to 24:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{24} (100k - 1250) = 100 \\sum_{k=0}^{24} k - 1250 \\times 25\n\\]\n\nThe sum \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{24} k = 300 \\).\n\nThus, the total sum is:\n\\[\n100 \\times 300 - 1250 \\times 25 = 30000 - 31250 = -1250\n\\]\n\nSince we are dealing with absolute differences, the negative sign indicates the direction of subtraction, but the magnitude is what matters. Therefore, the sum of the absolute differences is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1250}\n\\]"

The garden is 63 feet by 49 feet, and each patch is 7 feet by 7 feet. Therefore, the number of patches along the length is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{63}{7} = 9 \\]\n\nAnd the number of patches along the width is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{49}{7} = 7 \\]\n\nSo, the garden is divided into a grid of \\(9 \\times 7\\) patches, which gives us a total of:\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 7 = 63 \\]\n\nsquare patches.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many ways we can select two patches such that they do not touch each other. Two patches touch each other if they are adjacent either by the side or by the corner.\n\nTo find the number of ways to select two non-touching patches, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose any two patches from the 63 patches. This is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[ \\binom{63}{2} = \\frac{63 \\times 62}{2} = 1953 \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of ways to choose two patches that do touch each other. We consider two cases: patches that touch by the side and patches that touch by the corner.\n\n   - **Side-touching patches**: \n     - Horizontal pairs: There are 8 horizontal pairs in each of the 7 rows, giving \\(8 \\times 7 = 56\\) pairs.\n     - Vertical pairs: There are 6 vertical pairs in each of the 9 columns, giving \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\) pairs.\n     - Total side-touching pairs: \\(56 + 54 = 110\\)\n\n   - **Corner-touching patches**: \n     - Each 2x2 block of patches contributes 4 corner-touching pairs. There are \\(8 \\times 6 = 48\\) such blocks in the grid.\n     - Total corner-touching pairs: \\(48 \\times 4 = 192\\)\n\n3. The total number of touching pairs (either by side or corner) is the sum of side-touching and corner-touching pairs:\n\n\\[ 110 + 192 = 302 \\]\n\n4. Finally, subtract the number of touching pairs from the total number of ways to choose any two patches:\n\n\\[ 1953 - 302 = 1651 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to plant one patch of roses and one patch of mint so that they do not touch each other is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Answer: 1651} \\]"

            "To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions given and how they relate to probability.\n\n1. **Circle in the Complex Plane**: The circle is centered at the origin with a radius of 9. Therefore, any point \\( z = a + bi \\) on this circle satisfies the equation:\n   \\[\n   |z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Condition on the Product**: We are asked to find the probability that the product of the modulus of \\( z \\) and its imaginary part is at least 40.5. The modulus of \\( z \\) is 9 (since \\( z \\) is on the circle), so the condition becomes:\n   \\[\n   9 \\cdot |b| \\geq 40.5\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this inequality gives:\n   \\[\n   |b| \\geq \\frac{40.5}{9} = 4.5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Geometric Interpretation**: The imaginary part \\( b \\) of \\( z \\) must satisfy \\( |b| \\geq 4.5 \\). This means \\( b \\) must be either \\( b \\geq 4.5 \\) or \\( b \\leq -4.5 \\).\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**: The circle has a total diameter of 18 (since the radius is 9), and the range of \\( b \\) is from \\(-9\\) to \\(9\\). The segments where \\( |b| \\geq 4.5 \\) are:\n   - \\( b \\geq 4.5 \\) which corresponds to the arc from \\( b = 4.5 \\) to \\( b = 9 \\).\n   - \\( b \\leq -4.5 \\) which corresponds to the arc from \\( b = -9 \\) to \\( b = -4.5 \\).\n\n   Each of these segments corresponds to a vertical strip on the circle. The length of each strip (arc) is determined by the angle subtended by these segments at the center of the circle.\n\n5. **Arc Length Calculation**: The total vertical range of \\( b \\) is 18 (from \\(-9\\) to \\(9\\)). The range where \\( |b| \\geq 4.5 \\) is from \\(-9\\) to \\(-4.5\\) and from \\(4.5\\) to \\(9\\), each of which is a length of 4.5. Therefore, the total length of the arcs where \\( |b| \\geq 4.5 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   4.5 + 4.5 = 9\n   \\]\n\n6. **Probability**: The probability is the ratio of the favorable arc length to the total circumference of the circle. The circumference of the circle is:\n   \\[\n   2\\pi \\times 9 = 18\\pi\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the probability is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{18} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the product of the modulus and the imaginary part is at least 40.5 is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]"

The quadratic \\( x^2 - 3x + 3 \\) is a parabola opening upwards, and its vertex is at \\( x = \\frac{-b}{2a} = \\frac{3}{2} \\).

The expression becomes:\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 4x + 6 + (3 - x) = x^2 - 5x + 9\n   \\]\n\n   We need to find the minimum value of \\( x^2 - 5x + 9 \\) for \\( x < 3 \\). The vertex of this parabola is at \\( x = \\frac{-b}{2a} = \\frac{5}{2} \\).

Therefore, the roots are \\(7\\) and \\(8\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) for the quadratic equation with these roots.

Then the length is \\( 2w \\). The area of the rectangle is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   w \\times 2w = 200\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   2w^2 = 200\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   w^2 = 100\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   w = 10\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the dimensions of the field are \\( 10 \\) meters by \\( 20 \\) meters.\n\n2. **Determine the arrangement of the tiles:**\n\n   Each tile is a square with an area of 1 square meter, so each side of the tile is 1 meter. When a square tile is rotated by 45 degrees, it forms a diamond shape with respect to the field. The diagonal of this diamond is equal to the side of the square, which is 1 meter.\n\n   The diagonal of a square is given by \\( s\\sqrt{2} \\), where \\( s \\) is the side length of the square. Therefore, the side length of the square when rotated is:\n\n   \\[\n   s\\sqrt{2} = 1 \\implies s = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   The effective side length of the square when rotated is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the number of tiles that can fit:**\n\n   The number of tiles that can fit along the width of the field (10 meters) is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 10 \\times \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = 10\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n   The number of tiles that can fit along the length of the field (20 meters) is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 20 \\times \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = 20\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Since the number of tiles must be an integer, we take the floor of these values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\lfloor 10\\sqrt{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 14.14 \\rfloor = 14\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\lfloor 20\\sqrt{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 28.28 \\rfloor = 28\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the maximum number of tiles that can fit is \\( 14 \\times 28 = 392 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the area covered by the tiles:**\n\n   Each tile covers an area of 1 square meter, so the total area covered by the tiles is 392 square meters.\n\n5. **Calculate the grassy area:**\n\n   The total area of the field is 200 square meters. Since the tiles cover 392 square meters, which is not possible, we must have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's correct this:\n\n   The correct number of tiles that can fit is actually determined by the area of the field, not exceeding it. Since the field is 200 square meters, and each tile covers 1 square meter, the maximum number of tiles that can fit is 200.\n\n   Therefore, the grassy area is:\n\n   \\[\n   200 - 200 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   However, since the tiles are rotated, there will be some uncovered areas at the edges. The actual calculation should consider the effective coverage, but since the problem allows for grass in the un-tiled area, the minimum grassy area is the leftover from the tiling.\n\n   Given the constraints and the effective tiling, the minimum grassy area is:\n\n   \\[\n   200 - 196 = 4\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the minimum area of the grassy regions of the field is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Answer: 4}\n   \\]"

Each rectangle has its longer side of length \\(20\\sqrt{3}\\) feet tangent to the circle at its midpoint. This means the distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the longer side of the rectangle is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 10 feet.\n\nSince the longer side of the rectangle is tangent to the circle at its midpoint, the entire length of the longer side is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Therefore, the longer side of the rectangle is a chord of the circle.\n\nThe distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord (which is the point of tangency) is the radius of the circle, 10 feet. The length of the chord (the longer side of the rectangle) is \\(20\\sqrt{3}\\) feet.\n\nTo find the angle subtended by this chord at the center of the circle, we use the formula for the chord length in terms of the radius and the central angle \\(\\theta\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Chord length} = 2 \\times \\text{radius} \\times \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n20\\sqrt{3} = 2 \\times 10 \\times \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n20\\sqrt{3} = 20 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3} = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThe angle \\(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\) for which \\(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\sqrt{3}/2\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) radians (or 60 degrees).\n\nThus, \\(\\theta = 2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) radians.\n\nThe total angle around the circle is \\(2\\pi\\) radians.

            "To solve the problem, we need to find three-digit positive integers that satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. The integer is divisible by 5.\n2. When divided by 4, the remainder is 3.\n\nLet's break down the problem using these conditions:\n\n### Step 1: Divisibility by 5\nA number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. Therefore, any three-digit number divisible by 5 must end in 0 or 5.\n\n### Step 2: Remainder when divided by 4\nWe need numbers that give a remainder of 3 when divided by 4. This means the number can be expressed in the form \\( n = 4k + 3 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n### Combining the Conditions\nWe need numbers that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Let's consider each case:\n\n#### Case 1: Numbers ending in 0\nIf a number ends in 0, it can be expressed as \\( n = 10m \\) for some integer \\( m \\). For \\( n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\), we have:\n\\[ 10m \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\]\nSince \\( 10 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} \\), this simplifies to:\n\\[ 2m \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\]\nThis congruence has no solution because 2 and 4 are not coprime, and 3 is not divisible by 2. Therefore, no numbers ending in 0 satisfy both conditions.\n\n#### Case 2: Numbers ending in 5\nIf a number ends in 5, it can be expressed as \\( n = 10m + 5 \\) for some integer \\( m \\). For \\( n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\), we have:\n\\[ 10m + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\]\nSince \\( 10 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} \\) and \\( 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\), this simplifies to:\n\\[ 2m + 1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\]\n\\[ 2m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} \\]\n\\[ m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\]\nThis means \\( m \\) must be odd.\n\n### Finding the Range\nWe need to find the range of three-digit numbers ending in 5. The smallest three-digit number ending in 5 is 105, and the largest is 995.\n\nSince \\( m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\), \\( m \\) must be odd. Let's express \\( m \\) as \\( m = 2k + 1 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n- For 105: \\( 105 = 10(10) + 5 \\), so \\( m = 10 \\).\n- For 995: \\( 995 = 10(99) + 5 \\), so \\( m = 99 \\).\n\nThe odd values of \\( m \\) between 10 and 99 are 11, 13, 15, ..., 99. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 11 and the last term 99, with a common difference of 2.\n\n### Counting the Terms\nThe number of terms in this sequence is given by:\n\\[ n = \\frac{\\text{last term} - \\text{first term}}{\\text{common difference}} + 1 \\]\n\\[ n = \\frac{99 - 11}{2} + 1 = \\frac{88}{2} + 1 = 44 + 1 = 45 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 45 three-digit numbers that satisfy both conditions.\n\nAnswer: 45"

Here, \\( a = \\frac{-1}{2} \\) and \\( b = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\( a^2 + 4a + 4 \\):**\n   Substitute \\( a = \\frac{-1}{2} \\) into the expression \\( a^2 + 4a + 4 \\).\n\n   \\[\n   a^2 = \\left(\\frac{-1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   4a = 4 \\times \\frac{-1}{2} = -2\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   a^2 + 4a + 4 = \\frac{1}{4} - 2 + 4 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{8}{4} + \\frac{16}{4} = \\frac{9}{4}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( a^2 + 4a + 4 \\) is \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\)"

            "To solve this problem, we need to determine the expected average position of the gold medals when they are arranged such that no two gold medals are adjacent. We have 5 gold medals (G) and 7 silver medals (S), making a total of 12 positions.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the number of valid configurations\n\nTo ensure no two gold medals are adjacent, we can first place the 7 silver medals, which create 8 gaps (including the ends) where the gold medals can be placed:\n\n```\n_ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _\n```\n\nWe need to choose 5 out of these 8 gaps to place the gold medals. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{5} = \\binom{8}{3} = 56\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the expected position of the gold medals\n\nFor each valid configuration, we need to calculate the average position of the gold medals. Let's consider the positions of the gold medals as \\( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 \\). The average position is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5}{5}\n\\]\n\nTo find the expected value of this average position, we need to consider the contribution of each position to the total sum of positions across all configurations.\n\nEach position from 1 to 12 can be occupied by a gold medal, but we need to calculate how often each position is occupied by a gold medal across all valid configurations.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the contribution of each position\n\nSince the medals are placed such that no two gold medals are adjacent, the positions of the gold medals are distributed among the 8 gaps created by the silver medals. The expected position of each gold medal is symmetrically distributed around the center of the lineup due to the uniform random selection of configurations.\n\nThe positions of the gold medals are more likely to be in the middle of the lineup due to the constraints, but we can simplify the calculation by considering symmetry and uniform distribution.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the expected average position\n\nGiven the symmetry and uniform distribution, the expected average position of the gold medals is the average of all possible positions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected position} = \\frac{1 + 2 + \\ldots + 12}{12} = \\frac{78}{12} = 6.5\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the gold medals are constrained to not be adjacent, the expected average position will be slightly adjusted towards the center. Given the symmetry and the constraints, the expected average position of the gold medals is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected average position} = 6.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected location that the teacher stands at is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6.5}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: 6.5"

            "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct paths the frog can take from the origin (0,0) to the point (4,3) without crossing the line x + y = 5.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Path Constraints:**\n   - The frog can only move right (increase x) or up (increase y).\n   - The frog cannot cross the line x + y = 5. This means the frog can only visit points where x + y < 5.\n\n2. **Identify the Path without Constraints:**\n   - Without any constraints, the frog needs to make 4 right moves and 3 up moves to reach (4,3).\n   - The total number of moves is 7 (4 rights + 3 ups).\n   - The number of ways to arrange these moves is given by the binomial coefficient: \n     \\[\n     \\binom{7}{4} = \\binom{7}{3} = 35\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtract Paths that Cross the Barrier:**\n   - We need to subtract the paths that cross the line x + y = 5.\n   - If a path crosses the line, it must pass through one of the points on the line: (0,5), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), or (5,0).\n   - However, since the frog cannot move to (5,0) or (0,5) (as it would require more than 4 rights or 3 ups), we only consider points (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), and (4,1).\n\n4. **Calculate Paths Crossing the Barrier:**\n   - **Paths through (1,4):** \n     - To reach (1,4), the frog makes 1 right and 4 ups. The number of such paths is:\n       \\[\n       \\binom{5}{1} = 5\n       \\]\n     - From (1,4), the frog needs to reach (4,3), which is impossible because it would require moving down, which is not allowed.\n\n   - **Paths through (2,3):**\n     - To reach (2,3), the frog makes 2 rights and 3 ups. The number of such paths is:\n       \\[\n       \\binom{5}{2} = 10\n       \\]\n     - From (2,3), the frog needs to reach (4,3), which requires 2 more rights.

The number of such paths is:\n       \\[\n       \\binom{5}{3} = 10\n       \\]\n     - From (3,2), the frog needs to reach (4,3), which requires 1 right and 1 up. The number of such paths is:\n       \\[\n       \\binom{2}{1} = 2\n       \\]\n     - Total paths through (3,2) to (4,3) is \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\).\n\n   - **Paths through (4,1):**\n     - To reach (4,1), the frog makes 4 rights and 1 up. The number of such paths is:\n       \\[\n       \\binom{5}{4} = 5\n       \\]\n     - From (4,1), the frog needs to reach (4,3), which requires 2 ups. The number of such paths is:\n       \\[\n       \\binom{2}{2} = 1\n       \\]\n     - Total paths through (4,1) to (4,3) is \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\).\n\n5. **Total Paths Crossing the Barrier:**\n   - Total paths that cross the barrier are \\(10 + 20 + 5 = 35\\).\n\n6. **Calculate Valid Paths:**\n   - Subtract the paths that cross the barrier from the total paths without constraints:\n     \\[\n     35 - 35 = 0\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of distinct paths the frog can take to reach (4,3) without crossing the line x + y = 5 is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } 0\n\\]"

            "To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the infinite series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n}\\), where \\(p_n\\) is the probability that no two consecutive heads appear in the first \\(n\\) tosses of a fair coin.\n\nFirst, let's determine a recurrence relation for \\(p_n\\). Consider the possible outcomes for the first toss:\n\n1. If the first toss is a tail (T), then the remaining \\(n-1\\) tosses must also satisfy the condition of no two consecutive heads. The probability of this is \\(p_{n-1}\\).\n\n2. If the first toss is a head (H), then the second toss must be a tail (T) to avoid consecutive heads. The remaining \\(n-2\\) tosses must satisfy the condition. The probability of this is \\(p_{n-2}\\).\n\nThus, we have the recurrence relation:\n\\[\np_n = p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}\n\\]\nThis is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different initial conditions. We need to determine these initial conditions:\n\n- For \\(n=1\\), the possible sequences are \"H\" and \"T\". Only \"T\" satisfies the condition, so \\(p_1 = 1\\).\n\n- For \\(n=2\\), the possible sequences are \"HH\", \"HT\", \"TH\", and \"TT\". The sequences \"HT\", \"TH\", and \"TT\" satisfy the condition, so \\(p_2 = 3\\).\n\nNow, let's solve the recurrence relation with these initial conditions. The sequence \\(p_n\\) is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but shifted by one index. Specifically, \\(p_n\\) corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence shifted by one index, with \\(p_1 = 1\\) and \\(p_2 = 2\\).\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined as:\n\\[\nF_1 = 1, \\quad F_2 = 1, \\quad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\text{ for } n \\geq 3\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[\np_n = F_{n+1}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the series:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+1}}{2^n}\n\\]\n\nUsing the generating function for the Fibonacci sequence, we know:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} F_n x^n = \\frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}\n\\]\n\nWe want:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_{n+1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} F_{n+1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\n\\]\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} - 1 \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{4}} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2 - 1 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of the series is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: 2"
