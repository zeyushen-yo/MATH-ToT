Converting to a percentage and rounding to the nearest integer: 0% = 0\n\nThe solution from the simplified case (r = 1) directly extends to any radius r because the problem is scale-invariant, and the geometric relationship remains the same: all points on a semicircle are equidistant from its center.",

                    "Answer: 0\n\nThe current step, combined with the simplified problem's solution, directly leads us to the answer. Here's why:\n\n1. In our current setup with general radius r, the point M is at (r,0) and any point P is at (r\u00b7cos \u03b8 + r, r\u00b7sin \u03b8)\n\n2. The distance PM can be calculated as:\n   PM\u00b2 = [(r\u00b7cos \u03b8 + r - r)\u00b2 + (r\u00b7sin \u03b8 - 0)\u00b2]\n   = [r\u00b2cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + r\u00b2sin\u00b2 \u03b8]\n   = r\u00b2(cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8)\n   = r\u00b2\n\n3. Therefore, PM = r for ALL points P on the semicircle\n\n4. Since PM = r for all points, it can never be greater than r\n\n5. Thus, the probability that PM > r is 0%\n\nThe answer is 0 when expressed as a rounded percentage.\n\nThis matches perfectly with the geometric intuition: the semicircle is drawn with M as its center and radius r, so every point P on the semicircle is exactly distance r from M, never greater than r."
