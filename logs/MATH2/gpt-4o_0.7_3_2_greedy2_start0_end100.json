Calculate the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac = 16 + 48 = 64 \\), which is a perfect square. Thus, the roots are \\( y = \\frac{-4 \\pm 8}{8} \\), giving \\( y = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( y = -\\frac{3}{2} \\).

The inequality holds for \\( y \\leq -\\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( y \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nNext, solve the inequality \\( 4y^2 + 4y - 48 \\leq 0 \\).
