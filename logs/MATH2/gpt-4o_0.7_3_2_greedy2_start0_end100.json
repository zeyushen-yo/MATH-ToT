This is an arithmetic series where the first term \\( a_1 = 3 \\) and the last term \\( a_n = 99 \\), with a common difference \\( d = 3 \\). Determine the number of terms \\( n \\) in the series using the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence: \\( a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\times d \\). After finding \\( n \\), use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \\( S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) \\) to find the sum.\n\nNext, follow a similar process to calculate the sum of numbers less than 100 that are divisible by 7. The sequence is 7, 14, 21, ..., 98. The first term \\( a_1 = 7 \\) and the last term \\( a_n = 98 \\), with a common difference \\( d = 7 \\).\n\nFinally, calculate the sum of numbers less than 100 that are divisible by both 3 and 7, which are multiples of 21 (21, 42, 63, 84). Again, use the arithmetic series sum formula for this sequence, where the first term \\( a_1 = 21 \\) and the last term \\( a_n = 84 \\), with a common difference \\( d = 21 \\).\n\nNow, with these sums calculated, compute the sum of all numbers less than 100 that are divisible by either 3 or 7 using the inclusion-exclusion principle: add the sums of numbers divisible by 3 and 7, then subtract the sum of numbers divisible by both. Finally, subtract the numbers that are counted twice (those divisible by both 3 and 7) from the total."

                    "Possible next step: Given that the roots of the quadratic equation are two consecutive positive integers, and the product of the roots is 56, we previously determined that the roots are 7 and 8. Using Vieta's formulas, we derived the equations \\( c = 56a \\) and \\( b = -15a \\). \n\nTo explore all possible choices for the coefficients, we can consider different values of \\( a \\) such that \\( a \\neq 0 \\). For each choice of \\( a \\), the coefficients \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) can be calculated as \\( b = -15a \\) and \\( c = 56a \\), leading to \\( a + b + c = a - 15a + 56a = 42a \\).\n\nSince \\( a \\) can be any non-zero integer, the possible values for \\( (a + b + c) \\) are all integer multiples of 42, except 0. Each such choice is valid as long as it satisfies the conditions of the problem, which means any non-zero integer \\( a \\) results in a consistent set of coefficients.\n\nThe possible choices for \\( (a + b + c) \\) must be positive, as the roots are positive integers and the coefficients need to reflect this. Therefore, the valid choices are multiples of 42 (i.e., 42, 84, 126, etc.). Since there is no upper limit specified for these choices, theoretically, there are infinitely many positive choices for \\( (a + b + c) \\). \n\nAnswer: There are infinitely many choices for \\( (a + b + c) \\).",

The right-angled triangle has vertices at \\((0, 0)\\), \\((60, 0)\\), and \\((0, 80)\\). The path will meet the hypotenuse, which is the line joining \\((60, 0)\\) and \\((0, 80)\\), at a right angle.\n\n   To determine the number of lights, calculate the length of the path. Since the problem specifies that lights are placed 5 feet apart starting from the vertex of the right angle, we need to find the length of this path (altitude).\n\n   Using the formula for the area of a triangle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n   \\]\n   We know the area of the triangle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 \\times 80 = 2400 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n   The hypotenuse is 100 feet, so let \\(h\\) be the height from the right angle to the hypotenuse. The area of the triangle is also:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 \\times h = 2400\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(h\\):\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{2400 \\times 2}{100} = 48 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n   The number of lights needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{48}{5} = 9.6\n   \\]\n   Since you cannot have a fraction of a light, you need 10 lights.\n\n2. **Calculate the combined area of the two smaller triangles:**\n\n   The calculated height divides the original triangle into two smaller right triangles, each with a base along one of the original triangle's legs and height \\(h = 48\\) feet.\n\n   Since the total area of the original triangle is 2400 square feet and the path does not change this total area, the sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles is also 2400 square feet.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n\n   The total cost is the sum of the number of lights and the combined area of the triangles:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 10 (\\text{lights}) + 2400 (\\text{area}) = 2410\n   \\]\n\nThe current step already contains the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: 2410",
