Since the ball is passed to the right, we want to find out where it lands after 9 passes. \n\nLet's calculate the position. If we denote the starting position as 0 (the first person), after 9 passes, the position will be (0 + 9) mod 10 = 9. This means the ball will be at position 9 after 9 passes. \n\nNow, we can analyze the situation to see if the ball can return to the starting position after these passes. Since the ball started at a random position, we need to consider all starting positions. \n\nNext, we will check if it is possible for the ball to return to the starting position after passing it 9 times. This leads us to conclude that it can only return to the starting position if it started from position 9; otherwise, it will not return after 9 passes. \n\nAt this point, we can calculate the probability of the ball returning to the starting position after 9 passes by counting the favorable outcomes (1 out of 10 starting positions) over the total outcomes (10 starting positions). \n\nTherefore, the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times is 1/10.",
                    "First step: Analyze the passing pattern for 10 friends by labeling them as 0 through 9, where each number represents a friend.

Specifically, calculate the position of the ball after each pass using the formula (current position + 1) mod 10."
