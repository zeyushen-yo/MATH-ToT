            "To solve the inequality \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{x-1} \\geq \\frac{1}{8} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+2}\\), we will follow a step-by-step approach similar to the example.\n\n1. **Express both sides with the same base:**\n\n   We know that \\(\\frac{1}{4} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{8} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3\\). Therefore, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\right)^{x-1} \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the expressions:**\n\n   The left side becomes:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2(x-1)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1}\n   \\]\n\n   The right side becomes:\n\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}\n   \\]\n\n   So the inequality is now:\n\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compare the exponents:**\n\n   Since the base \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is less than 1, the inequality sign will reverse when we compare the exponents:\n\n   \\[\n   2x - 1 \\leq x + 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the inequality for \\(x\\):**\n\n   - Subtract \\(x\\) from both sides:\n\n     \\[\n     2x - x - 1 \\leq 5\n     \\]\n\n   - Simplify:\n\n     \\[\n     x - 1 \\leq 5\n     \\]\n\n   - Add 1 to both sides:\n\n     \\[\n     x \\leq 6\n     \\]\n\nThus, the solution to the inequality is:\n\n\\[\nx \\leq 6\n\\]\n\nThis means that for any \\(x\\) less than or equal to 6, the original inequality \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{x-1} \\geq \\frac{1}{8} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+2}\\) holds true.\n\nAnswer: \\(x \\leq 6\\)"

Therefore, after 9 passes, the ball will be with the person immediately to the left of the starting person.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - Since the ball cannot return to the starting person after exactly 9 passes (as it requires 10 passes to complete a full cycle), the probability is 0.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times is 0.\n\nAnswer: 0"

Therefore, the amount of water in the container at each subsequent minute can be described by the following sequence:\n\n- At minute 0: \\( W_0 = 0.5 \\) liters\n- At minute 1: \\( W_1 = W_0 + \\frac{1}{2}W_0 = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75 \\) liters\n- At minute 2: \\( W_2 = W_1 + \\frac{1}{2}W_1 = 0.75 + 0.375 = 1.125 \\) liters\n- At minute 3: \\( W_3 = W_2 + \\frac{1}{2}W_2 = 1.125 + 0.5625 = 1.6875 \\) liters\n- At minute 4: \\( W_4 = W_3 + \\frac{1/2}W_3 = 1.6875 + 0.84375 = 2.53125 \\) liters\n\nWe observe that the amount of water in the container follows a geometric series. The general formula for the amount of water at minute \\( k \\) is:\n\n\\[\nW_k = 0.5 + 0.5 \\times \\frac{1}{2} + 0.5 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\cdots + 0.5 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term \\( a = 0.5 \\) and common ratio \\( r = \\frac{1}{2} \\). The sum of the first \\( k+1 \\) terms of a geometric series is given by:\n\n\\[\nS_k = 0.5 \\times \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{k+1}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 1 \\times \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{k+1}\\right)\n\\]\n\nAs \\( k \\to \\infty \\), the series converges to:\n\n\\[\nS = 1\n\\]\n\nThis means that the amount of water in the container approaches 1 liter as time goes on. We need to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the amount of water is never in the interval \\([n, n+1]\\).\n\nSince the amount of water approaches 1, it will eventually be in any interval that includes 1. Therefore, the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the amount of water is never in \\([n, n+1]\\) is \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the number of liters of water in the container is never in the interval \\([n, n+1]\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"

            "To solve the original problem, we need to determine the number of ways to plant roses and mint in a 63x49 feet garden divided into 7x7 feet square patches such that they do not touch each other. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Patches:**\n   - The garden is 63 feet by 49 feet.\n   - Each patch is 7 feet by 7 feet.\n   - Therefore, the number of patches along the length is \\( \\frac{63}{7} = 9 \\).\n   - The number of patches along the width is \\( \\frac{49}{7} = 7 \\).\n   - Thus, the garden is divided into a 9x7 grid of patches.\n\n2. **Total Number of Ways to Plant Roses and Mint:**\n   - There are \\(9 \\times 7 = 63\\) patches in total.\n   - We can choose any one of these 63 patches to plant roses.\n   - After planting roses, there are 62 remaining patches where we can plant mint.\n   - Therefore, the total number of ways to plant roses and mint without any restrictions is \\(63 \\times 62 = 3906\\).\n\n3. **Identifying Touching Patches:**\n   - If a patch is chosen for roses, we need to identify which patches are touching it.\n   - For a given patch, the touching patches include those directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) and those diagonally adjacent (corner touching).\n\n4. **Counting Non-Touching Configurations:**\n   - We will consider each patch one by one, calculate the number of touching patches, and then determine the number of non-touching patches available for mint.\n\n   Let's analyze each type of patch:\n\n   - **Corner Patches (4 corners):** \n     - Each corner patch has 3 touching patches.\n     - Therefore, for each corner patch, there are \\(62 - 3 = 59\\) non-touching patches available for mint.\n\n   - **Edge (Non-Corner) Patches:**\n     - Each edge (non-corner) patch has 5 touching patches.\n     - Therefore, for each edge (non-corner) patch, there are \\(62 - 5 = 57\\) non-touching patches available for mint.\n\n   - **Inner Patches (Non-Edge, Non-Corner):**\n     - Each inner patch has 8 touching patches.\n     - Therefore, for each inner patch, there are \\(62 - 8 = 54\\) non-touching patches available for mint.\n\n5. **Calculating Total Non-Touching Configurations:**\n   - There are 4 corner patches, each allowing 59 non-touching configurations.\n   - There are \\(2 \\times (9 + 7 - 4) = 24\\) edge (non-corner) patches, each allowing 57 non-touching configurations.\n   - There are \\(9 \\times 7 - 4 - 24 = 35\\) inner patches, each allowing 54 non-touching configurations.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of non-touching configurations is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 59 + 24 \\times 57 + 35 \\times 54 = 236 + 1368 + 1890 = 3494\n   \\]\n\nThus, there are 3494 ways to plant roses and mint in the 9x7 grid such that they do not touch each other.

Then, we need to determine the number on the card that maximizes the sum of its digits, and if there are multiple such cards, find the sum of the digits of the smallest card.\n\n### Step 1: Determine \\(\\binom{N}{5}\\) divisibility conditions\n\nThe formula for the number of ways to choose 5 distinct cards from \\( N \\) cards is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{N}{5} = \\frac{N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)(N-4)}{120}\n\\]\n\nWe need \\(\\binom{N}{5}\\) to be divisible by both 3 and 4, but not by 5. This means:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)(N-4)}{120}\\) is an integer.\n2. \\(\\frac{N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)(N-4)}{120}\\) is divisible by 3.\n3. \\(\\frac{N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)(N-4)}{120}\\) is divisible by 4.\n4. \\(\\frac{N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)(N-4)}{120}\\) is not divisible by 5.\n\n### Step 2: Check divisibility by 3 and 4\n\nFor \\(\\binom{N}{5}\\) to be divisible by 3, the product \\(N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)(N-4)\\) must be divisible by 360 (since 360 is the least common multiple of 120, 3, and 4). This means that among \\(N\\), \\(N-1\\), \\(N-2\\), \\(N-3\\), and \\(N-4\\), at least one must be divisible by 3, and at least two must be divisible by 2.\n\n### Step 3: Check divisibility by 5\n\nFor \\(\\binom{N}{5}\\) not to be divisible by 5, the product \\(N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)(N-4)\\) must not be divisible by 600 (since 600 is the least common multiple of 120 and 5). This means that among \\(N\\), \\(N-1\\), \\(N-2\\), \\(N-3\\), and \\(N-4\\), at most one can be divisible by 5.\n\n### Step 4: Find the smallest \\( N \\)\n\nLet's test small values of \\( N \\):\n\n- \\( N = 10 \\):\n  \\[\n  \\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{120} = 252\n  \\]\n  252 is divisible by 3 and 4, but not by 5. So, \\( N = 10 \\) satisfies the conditions.\n\n### Step 5: Maximize the sum of digits\n\nNow, we need to find the number on the card that maximizes the sum of its digits. For \\( N = 10 \\), the cards are numbered 1 to 10. The sum of the digits for each card is:\n\n- Card 1: Sum of digits = 1\n- Card 2: Sum of digits = 2\n- Card 3: Sum of digits = 3\n- Card 4: Sum of digits = 4\n- Card 5: Sum of digits = 5\n- Card 6: Sum of digits = 6\n- Card 7: Sum of digits = 7\n- Card 8: Sum of digits = 8\n- Card 9: Sum of digits = 9\n- Card 10: Sum of digits = 1\n\nThe maximum sum of digits is 9, which corresponds to card number 9.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smallest positive integer \\( N \\) such that \\(\\binom{N}{5}\\) is divisible by both 3 and 4, but not by 5, is \\( N = 10 \\). The number on the card that maximizes the sum of its digits is 9, and the sum of the digits of this card is 9.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"

The area of the original triangle is 2400 square feet, as calculated earlier.\n\n2. **Area of the Smaller Triangles**: Since the path is the altitude to the hypotenuse, it divides the original triangle into two smaller triangles with the same combined area as the original triangle.\n\n   **Combined Area of Smaller Triangles**: 2400 square feet\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total\n\nThe total is the sum of the number of lights and the combined area of the two smaller triangles:\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = \\text{Number of Lights} + \\text{Combined Area} = 10 + 2400 = 2410\n\\]\n\nThus, the total is 2410.\n\nAnswer: 2410"

We will then calculate the expected position of the gold medals across all valid configurations.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Valid Configurations:**\n   - We need to place the gold medals such that they are not adjacent. This means there must be at least one silver medal between any two gold medals.\n   - We can start by placing the silver medals first and then find the valid positions for the gold medals.\n\n2. **Place Silver Medals:**\n   - Consider the positions for the silver medals: S _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S. This leaves us with six gaps (indicated by underscores) where the gold medals can be placed.\n\n3. **Determine Gold Medal Positions:**\n   - We need to choose 5 out of these 6 gaps to place the gold medals. This can be done in \\(\\binom{6}{5} = 6\\) ways.\n\n4. **Calculate the Average Position:**\n   - For each configuration, determine the positions of the gold medals and calculate their average position.\n   - Let's denote the positions of the silver medals as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13. The gaps are between these positions.\n   - The possible configurations and their average positions are:\n     1. G S G S G S G S G S S \u2192 Positions: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 \u2192 Average = (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9) / 5 = 5\n     2.

First, calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{4 + 4 + 6}{2} = 7\n   \\]\n\n   Now, use Heron's formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( a = 4 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), and \\( c = 6 \\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\sqrt{7(7-4)(7-4)(7-6)} = \\sqrt{7 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 1} = \\sqrt{63}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = 3\\sqrt{7} \\approx 7.937 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the volume of the triangular prism:**\n\n   The volume of a triangular prism is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = \\text{base area} \\times \\text{height}\n   \\]\n\n   Here, the base area of the triangular prism is approximately \\( 7.937 \\) square meters, and the height of the prism is 2 meters.

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of drones needed:**\n   - Each drone can carry 12 toys.\n   - The total number of toys to be transported is 360.\n   - To find the number of drones required, divide the total number of toys by the number of toys each drone can carry:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of drones} = \\frac{360 \\text{ toys}}{12 \\text{ toys/drone}} = 30 \\text{ drones}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the time it takes for a drone to reach the retailer:**\n   - The path of each drone is given by the parametric equations \\((x(t), y(t)) = (3t, 5t)\\).\n   - The retailer location is the endpoint of the path. Since the path is linear and each drone travels directly, we need to find the time \\(t\\) when the drone reaches the retailer.\n   - Assume the retailer is at a certain distance \\(d\\) from the starting point. The distance traveled by a drone in time \\(t\\) is given by the Euclidean distance:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{(3t)^2 + (5t)^2} = \\sqrt{9t^2 + 25t^2} = \\sqrt{34t^2} = \\sqrt{34}t\n     \\]\n   - Since the exact distance \\(d\\) is not specified, we assume the time taken for each drone to reach the retailer is the same for all drones. Let's denote this time as \\(T\\).\n\n3. **Determine the time difference between the first and last drone arriving:**\n   - The first drone starts at \\(t=0\\) and takes time \\(T\\) to reach the retailer.\n   - The last (30th) drone starts at \\(t = 58\\) minutes (as calculated in the example solution) and also takes time \\(T\\) to reach the retailer.\n   - Therefore, the time at which the last drone arrives is \\(58 + T\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the time difference in arrival:**\n   - The first drone arrives at time \\(T\\).\n   - The last drone arrives at time \\(58 + T\\).\n   - The time difference between the first and last drone arriving is:\n     \\[\n     (58 + T) - T = 58 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the time difference between the first and last drone to arrive at the retailer location is 58 minutes.\n\nAnswer: 58 minutes"

The first six non-trivial factors (excluding 1 and 720) are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.\n\n2. **Calculate the Sum of the First Six Non-Trivial Factors:**\n   We need to find the sum of these factors:\n   \\[\n   2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 = 28\n   \\]\n\n3. **Relate the Sum to the Circumference of the Circle:**\n   The circumference \\( C \\) of a circle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   C = 2\\pi r\n   \\]\n   According to the problem, the circumference is equal to 28. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   2\\pi r = 28\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for the Radius \\( r \\):**\n   To find the radius, we need to solve the equation for \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{28}{2\\pi}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Numerical Value of the Radius:**\n   We need to compute the value of \\( r \\) using the approximation \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14159\\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{28}{2 \\times 3.14159} \\approx \\frac{28}{6.28318} \\approx 4.456\n   \\]\n\n6. **Round the Radius to the Nearest Whole Number:**\n   The approximate value of the radius is 4.456. Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives:\n   \\[\n   r \\approx 4\n   \\]\n\nThus, the radius of the circle, rounded to the nearest whole number, is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).\n\nAnswer: 4"

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem Recursively\n\nFirst, we need to find a recursive formula for \\(p_n\\). Consider the possible outcomes for the first \\(n\\) tosses:\n\n- If the first toss is a tail (T), then the remaining \\(n-1\\) tosses must also satisfy the condition of no two consecutive heads. The probability of this is \\(p_{n-1}\\).\n- If the first toss is a head (H), the second toss must be a tail (T) to avoid consecutive heads. The remaining \\(n-2\\) tosses must satisfy the condition. The probability of this is \\(p_{n-2}\\).\n\nThus, the recursive relation is:\n\\[\np_n = p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Establish Base Cases\n\nWe need base cases to start the recursion:\n\n- For \\(n = 1\\), the sequences are H and T. Only T is favorable, so \\(p_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n- For \\(n = 2\\), the sequences are HH, HT, TH, TT. The favorable ones are HT, TH, TT, so \\(p_2 = \\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Recurrence Relation\n\nThe recurrence relation \\(p_n = p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}\\) with initial conditions \\(p_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(p_2 = \\frac{3}{4}\\) is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. We can express \\(p_n\\) in terms of the Fibonacci numbers \\(F_n\\):\n\n\\[\np_n = \\frac{F_{n+2}}{2^n}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(F_n\\) is the \\(n\\)-th Fibonacci number with \\(F_1 = 1\\) and \\(F_2 = 1\\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Infinite Sum\n\nWe need to find:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+2}}{2^{2n}}\n\\]\n\nThis is a known generating function for the Fibonacci sequence:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+2}}{4^n} = \\frac{1}{1 - x - x^2} \\bigg|_{x = \\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x = \\frac{1}{4}\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{16}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{11}{16}} = \\frac{16}{11}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the infinite sum is \\(\\frac{16}{11}\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(\\frac{16}{11}\\)"

            "To solve the original problem, we need to determine the number of ways to form a team of 5 people from a group of 8 men and 6 women, with the condition that the team must include at least 2 men and 2 women. Let's break down the problem into cases based on the number of men and women in the team.\n\n### Case Analysis\n\n1. **Case 1: 2 men and 3 women**\n   - Choose 2 men from 8 men: \\(\\binom{8}{2}\\)\n   - Choose 3 women from 6 women: \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\)\n\n   The number of ways for this case is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 28 \\times 20 = 560\n   \\]\n\n2. **Case 2: 3 men and 2 women**\n   - Choose 3 men from 8 men: \\(\\binom{8}{3}\\)\n   - Choose 2 women from 6 women: \\(\\binom{6}{2}\\)\n\n   The number of ways for this case is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{3} \\times \\binom{6}{2} = 56 \\times 15 = 840\n   \\]\n\n### Total Number of Ways\n\nTo find the total number of ways to form the team, we add the number of ways from each case:\n\\[\n560 + 840 = 1400\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 1400 ways to choose a team of 5 people from a group of 8 men and 6 women, ensuring that the team includes at least 2 men and 2 women.\n\nAnswer: 1400"
