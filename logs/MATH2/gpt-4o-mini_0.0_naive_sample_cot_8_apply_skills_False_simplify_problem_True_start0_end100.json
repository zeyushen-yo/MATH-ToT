The game starts with the ball being given to a random person. What is the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times?\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. **Understanding the Passing Sequence**:\n   - When a person receives the ball, they pass it to the person on their right.\n   - The passing sequence can be represented as follows:\n     - If person 1 starts with the ball, the sequence of passes will be:\n       - 1st pass: 1 \u2192 2\n       - 2nd pass: 2 \u2192 3\n       - 3rd pass: 3 \u2192 4\n       - ...\n       - 9th pass: 9 \u2192 10\n       - 10th pass: 10 \u2192 1 (returns to the starting person)\n\n2. **Identifying the Starting Person**:\n   - Let's denote the starting person as \\( P \\). The possible starting persons are 1, 2, 3, ..., or 10.\n\n3. **Calculating the Passes**:\n   - We need to determine the position of the ball after 9 passes, starting from each person:\n     - If \\( P = 1 \\):\n       - 1st pass: 1 \u2192 2\n       - 2nd pass: 2 \u2192 3\n       - 3rd pass: 3 \u2192 4\n       - 4th pass: 4 \u2192 5\n       - 5th pass: 5 \u2192 6\n       - 6th pass: 6 \u2192 7\n       - 7th pass: 7 \u2192 8\n       - 8th pass: 8 \u2192 9\n       - 9th pass: 9 \u2192 10 (ends at 10)\n     - If \\( P = 2 \\):\n       - 1st pass: 2 \u2192 3\n       - 2nd pass: 3 \u2192 4\n       - 3rd pass: 4 \u2192 5\n       - 4th pass: 5 \u2192 6\n       - 5th pass: 6 \u2192 7\n       - 6th pass: 7 \u2192 8\n       - 7th pass: 8 \u2192 9\n       - 8th pass: 9 \u2192 10\n       - 9th pass: 10 \u2192 1 (ends at 1)\n     - Continuing this way, we can see that:\n       - If \\( P = 3 \\): Ends at 2\n       - If \\( P = 4 \\): Ends at 3\n       - If \\( P = 5 \\): Ends at 4\n       - If \\( P = 6 \\): Ends at 5\n       - If \\( P = 7 \\): Ends at 6\n       - If \\( P = 8 \\): Ends at 7\n       - If \\( P = 9 \\): Ends at 8\n       - If \\( P = 10 \\): Ends at 9\n\n4. **Finding the Return Condition**:\n   - We want to find the cases where the ball returns to the starting person \\( P \\) after 9 passes:\n     - From the sequences above, we can see:\n       - Starting from 1: Ends at 10 (not 1)\n       - Starting from 2: Ends at 1 (returns to 2)\n       - Starting from 3: Ends at 2 (not 3)\n       - Starting from 4: Ends at 3 (not 4)\n       - Starting from 5: Ends at 4 (not 5)\n       - Starting from 6: Ends at 5 (not 6)\n       - Starting from 7: Ends at 6 (not 7)\n       - Starting from 8: Ends at 7 (not 8)\n       - Starting from 9: Ends at 8 (not 9)\n       - Starting from 10: Ends at 9 (not 10)\n\n5. **Counting Successful Outcomes**:\n   - The only successful outcome where the ball returns to the starting person after 9 passes is when the ball starts with person 1 and returns to person 1.\n\n6. **Calculating the Probability**:\n   - There are 10 possible starting persons (1, 2, 3, ..., 10).\n   - Out of these, only 1 starting person (1) results in the ball returning to them after 9 passes.\n   - Therefore, the probability \\( P \\) that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times is:\n     \\[\n     P = \\frac{\\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\\text{Total possible outcomes}} = \\frac{1}{10}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]",

The possible starting persons are 1, 2, 3, ..., or 10.\n\n3. **Calculating the Passes**:\n   - We need to determine the position of the ball after 9 passes, starting from each person:\n     - If \\( P = 1 \\):\n       - 1st pass: 1 \u2192 2\n       - 2nd pass: 2 \u2192 3\n       - 3rd pass: 3 \u2192 4\n       - 4th pass: 4 \u2192 5\n       - 5th pass: 5 \u2192 6\n       - 6th pass: 6 \u2192 7\n       - 7th pass: 7 \u2192 8\n       - 8th pass: 8 \u2192 9\n       - 9th pass: 9 \u2192 10 (ends at 10)\n     - If \\( P = 2 \\):\n       - 1st pass: 2 \u2192 3\n       - 2nd pass: 3 \u2192 4\n       - 3rd pass: 4 \u2192 5\n       - 4th pass: 5 \u2192 6\n       - 5th pass: 6 \u2192 7\n       - 6th pass: 7 \u2192 8\n       - 7th pass: 8 \u2192 9\n       - 8th pass: 9 \u2192 10\n       - 9th pass: 10 \u2192 1 (ends at 1)\n     - Continuing this way, we can see that:\n       - If \\( P = 3 \\): Ends at 2\n       - If \\( P = 4 \\): Ends at 3\n       - If \\( P = 5 \\): Ends at 4\n       - If \\( P = 6 \\): Ends at 5\n       - If \\( P = 7 \\): Ends at 6\n       - If \\( P = 8 \\): Ends at 7\n       - If \\( P = 9 \\): Ends at 8\n       - If \\( P = 10 \\): Ends at 9\n\n4. **Finding the Return Condition**:\n   - We want to find the cases where the ball returns to the starting person \\( P \\) after 9 passes:\n     - From the sequences above, we can see:\n       - Starting from 1: Ends at 10 (not 1)\n       - Starting from 2: Ends at 1 (returns to 2)\n       - Starting from 3: Ends at 2 (not 3)\n       - Starting from 4: Ends at 3 (not 4)\n       - Starting from 5: Ends at 4 (not 5)\n       - Starting from 6: Ends at 5 (not 6)\n       - Starting from 7: Ends at 6 (not 7)\n       - Starting from 8: Ends at 7 (not 8)\n       - Starting from 9: Ends at 8 (not 9)\n       - Starting from 10: Ends at 9 (not 10)\n\n5. **Counting Successful Outcomes**:\n   - The only successful outcome where the ball returns to the starting person after 9 passes is when the ball starts with person 1 and returns to person 1.\n\n6. **Calculating the Probability**:\n   - There are 10 possible starting persons (1, 2, 3, ..., 10).\n   - Out of these, only 1 starting person (1) results in the ball returning to them after 9 passes.\n   - Therefore, the probability \\( P \\) that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times is:\n     \\[\n     P = \\frac{\\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\\text{Total possible outcomes}} = \\frac{1}{10}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]",

Since the maximum number of items in any box can be 11, we will explore combinations of the identified primes.\n\n1. **All boxes have 2 items**: \n   - \\( 2 + 2 + 7 = 11 \\) (valid)\n   - \\( 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 \\) (6 is not prime)\n   - \\( 2 + 5 + 4 = 11 \\) (4 is not prime)\n   - \\( 2 + 7 + 2 = 11 \\) (valid)\n   - \\( 2 + 11 + 0 = 11 \\) (0 is not prime)\n\n2. **All boxes have 3 items**:\n   - \\( 3 + 3 + 5 = 11 \\) (valid)\n   - \\( 3 + 2 + 6 = 11 \\) (6 is not prime)\n   - \\( 3 + 5 + 3 = 11 \\) (valid)\n   - \\( 3 + 7 + 1 = 11 \\) (1 is not prime)\n\n3. **All boxes have 5 items**:\n   - \\( 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 \\) (1 is not prime)\n   - \\( 5 + 3 + 3 = 11 \\) (valid)\n\n4. **All boxes have 7 items**:\n   - \\( 7 + 2 + 2 = 11 \\) (valid)\n\n5. **All boxes have 11 items**:\n   - \\( 11 + 0 + 0 = 11 \\) (0 is not prime)\n\n### Step 4: List valid combinations\nFrom the combinations we explored, the valid distributions of prime numbers that sum to 11 are:\n\n1. \\( (2, 2, 7) \\)\n2. \\( (2, 7, 2) \\)\n3. \\( (3, 3, 5) \\)\n4. \\( (3, 5, 3) \\)\n5. \\( (5, 3, 3) \\)\n6. \\( (7, 2, 2) \\)\n\n### Step 5: Count distinct arrangements\nNow we need to count the distinct arrangements of these combinations:\n\n- For \\( (2, 2, 7) \\) and its permutations: \n  - There are \\( \\frac{3!}{2!} = 3 \\) arrangements.\n  \n- For \\( (3, 3, 5) \\) and its permutations:\n  - There are \\( \\frac{3!}{2!} = 3 \\) arrangements.\n\n- For \\( (2, 7, 2) \\) and its permutations:\n  - This is already counted in \\( (2, 2, 7) \\).\n\n- For \\( (3, 5, 3) \\) and its permutations:\n  - This is already counted in \\( (3, 3, 5) \\).\n\n- For \\( (5, 3, 3) \\) and its permutations:\n  - This is already counted in \\( (3, 3, 5) \\).\n\n- For \\( (7, 2, 2) \\) and its permutations:\n  - This is already counted in \\( (2, 2, 7) \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total number of distinct arrangements is:\n\n\\[\n3 + 3 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ways to distribute 11 identical items into 3 distinct boxes, where the number of items in each box is a prime number, is:\n\nAnswer: \\(\\boxed{6}\\)"

            "To solve the original problem, we start with an initial amount of water in the container, which is 500 mL. The scientist adds water to the container every minute, specifically adding \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the current amount of water.\n\nLet's denote the amount of water in the container at time \\( t \\) (in minutes) as \\( W(t) \\). The initial condition is:\n\n\\[\nW(0) = 500 \\text{ mL}\n\\]\n\nAt each minute, the amount of water added is \\( \\frac{1}{2} W(t) \\). Therefore, the amount of water after one minute can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nW(1) = W(0) + \\frac{1}{2} W(0) = W(0) \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = W(0) \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nContinuing this process, we can derive a general formula for \\( W(t) \\):\n\n\\[\nW(t) = W(0) \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^t\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the initial amount:\n\n\\[\nW(t) = 500 \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^t \\text{ mL}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to convert this amount from milliliters to liters, knowing that \\( 1 \\text{ L} = 1000 \\text{ mL} \\):\n\n\\[\nW(t) = \\frac{500}{1000} \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^t = 0.5 \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^t \\text{ L}\n\\]\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the amount of water in liters, \\( W(t) \\), is never in the interval \\( [n, n+1] \\) for any \\( t \\).\n\nTo analyze this, we need to determine the behavior of \\( W(t) \\) as \\( t \\) increases.

            "To solve the problem of how many ways we can choose 5 consecutive integers from the set of the first 100 natural numbers such that their sum is divisible by 10 but not by 15, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Set of Consecutive Integers**: The first 100 natural numbers are {1, 2, 3, ..., 100}. The consecutive integers we can choose will be of the form \\( n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4 \\), where \\( n \\) can take values from 1 to 96 (since \\( n+4 \\) must be less than or equal to 100).\n\n2. **Calculate the Sum of 5 Consecutive Integers**: The sum of five consecutive integers \\( n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   S = n + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) + (n+4) = 5n + 10 = 5(n + 2)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Check Divisibility by 10**: The expression \\( S = 5(n + 2) \\) is divisible by 10 if \\( n + 2 \\) is even. This occurs when \\( n \\) is even.

The terms are \\( 4, 6, 8, \\ldots, 98 \\). The terms divisible by 3 in this sequence are:\n   - 6, 12, 18, ..., 96.\n\n   This is another arithmetic sequence:\n   - First term \\( a = 6 \\)\n   - Common difference \\( d = 6 \\)\n   - Last term \\( l = 96 \\)\n\n   To find the number of terms \\( p \\):\n   \\[\n   96 = 6 + (p-1) \\cdot 6\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   96 - 6 = (p-1) \\cdot 6 \\implies 90 = (p-1) \\cdot 6 \\implies p-1 = 15 \\implies p = 16\n   \\]\n   So, there are 16 terms that are divisible by 3.\n\n6. **Final Count**: The total number of valid choices for \\( n \\) is 48 (even \\( n \\)), and we need to exclude the 16 choices where \\( n + 2 \\) is divisible by 3.

The square numbers less than or equal to \\( 81 \\) are:\n   - \\( 0^2 = 0 \\)\n   - \\( 1^2 = 1 \\)\n   - \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n   - \\( 4^2 = 16 \\)\n   - \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n   - \\( 6^2 = 36 \\)\n   - \\( 7^2 = 49 \\)\n   - \\( 8^2 = 64 \\)\n   - \\( 9^2 = 81 \\)\n\n   Now we check which of these square numbers divide \\( 81 \\):\n   - \\( 81 \\div 1 = 81 \\) (divides)\n   - \\( 81 \\div 4 = 20.25 \\) (does not divide)\n   - \\( 81 \\div 9 = 9 \\) (divides)\n   - \\( 81 \\div 16 = 5.0625 \\) (does not divide)\n   - \\( 81 \\div 25 = 3.24 \\) (does not divide)\n   - \\( 81 \\div 36 = 2.25 \\) (does not divide)\n   - \\( 81 \\div 49 = 1.65306122449 \\) (does not divide)\n   - \\( 81 \\div 64 = 1.265625 \\) (does not divide)\n   - \\( 81 \\div 81 = 1 \\) (divides)\n\n   The square numbers that divide \\( 81 \\) are \\( 1, 9, \\) and \\( 81 \\). Among these, the largest is \\( 81 \\).\n\nThus, the largest square number that exactly divides the sum of the cube's surface area and the square of the length of the line segment is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{81}\n\\]"

Substituting back gives:\n\\[\nx = 5(7m + 4) + 4 = 35m + 20 + 4 = 35m + 24\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx \\equiv 24 \\mod 35\n\\]\n\nNow substituting into the first congruence:\n\\[\n35m + 24 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\implies 2m + 0 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\implies m \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\n\\]\nSo, \\(m = 3n\\) for some integer \\(n\\). Substituting back gives:\n\\[\nx = 35(3n) + 24 = 105n + 24\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx \\equiv 24 \\mod 105\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe remainder when \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{49} (4n)!\\) is divided by \\(105\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]"

The bounding box of a square rotated 45 degrees has dimensions:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Width} = \\text{Height} = \\sqrt{2} \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of tiles that can fit**:\n   The rectangle has dimensions \\( 20 \\) meters by \\( 10 \\) meters. The area of the rectangle is 200 square meters, and since each tile occupies an effective area of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 2 \\) square meters when rotated, we can calculate how many tiles can fit.\n\n   The number of tiles that can fit along the length and width of the rectangle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Along length} = \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{2}} = 10\\sqrt{2} \\approx 14.14 \\quad \\text{(approximately 14 tiles)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Along width} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\approx 7.07 \\quad \\text{(approximately 7 tiles)}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the maximum number of tiles that can fit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total tiles} = 14 \\times 7 = 98 \\text{ tiles}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the minimum area of grassy regions**:\n   Since the tiles cannot completely cover the area due to their orientation, we need to find the area that remains uncovered. The area that can be tiled will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area covered by tiles} = 98 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n   Thus, the minimum area of the grassy regions will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of grassy regions} = 200 - 98 = 102 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: 102 square meters}\n\\]"

            "To solve the original problem, we will follow a similar step-by-step approach as in the simplified problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry\n1. The circular garden has a radius of 10 feet. Therefore, the distance from the center of the circle to the edge of the circle is 10 feet.\n2. The flower beds are rectangular with dimensions 5 feet by \\( 20\\sqrt{3} \\) feet. The longer side (\\( 20\\sqrt{3} \\) feet) will be placed tangentially to the circle.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Position of the Flower Beds\n1. The middle point of the longer side (\\( 20\\sqrt{3} \\) feet) of the rectangle will be tangent to the circle. This means that the distance from the center of the circle to this point of tangency is equal to the radius of the circle (10 feet).\n2. The longer side of the rectangle (\\( 20\\sqrt{3} \\) feet) will extend \\( 10\\sqrt{3} \\) feet on either side of this tangential point.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Effective Radius\n1. Since the middle point of the longer side of the rectangle is 10 feet from the center of the circle, the edges of the rectangle will extend \\( 10\\sqrt{3} \\) feet on either side of this point.\n2. Therefore, the distance from the center of the circle to the outer edge of the rectangle is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ feet} + 10\\sqrt{3} \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Circumference of the Circle\n1. The circumference of the circle can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   C = 2\\pi r\n   \\]\n   where \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. Here, \\( r = 10 \\) feet.\n   \\[\n   C = 2\\pi \\times 10 = 20\\pi \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Space Taken by Each Flower Bed\n1.

Calculate the expected position:\n   - The expected position of the gold medals can be calculated by averaging the positions of the gold medals across all valid arrangements.\n\n   - The average position of the gold medals can be calculated as follows:\n     - The average position of the gaps is the average of the first 8 positions (1 to 8):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average gap position} = \\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8}{8} = \\frac{36}{8} = 4.5\n     \\]\n\n   - Since we are placing 5 gold medals in these gaps, we can find the expected position of the gold medals by considering the average position of the selected gaps.\n\n### Final Calculation of Expected Position\n\nTo find the overall expected position of the gold medals, we can average the expected positions of the gold medals across the valid arrangements. Since the average gap position is 4.5, we can conclude that the expected position of the gold medals in the lineup is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected position of gold medals} = 4.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected location that the teacher stands at is:\n\nAnswer: 4.5"

Since \\( r = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\), we know:\n\n\\[\nr \\geq a > x\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( r = -x + 10 \\) into the inequality gives:\n\n\\[\n-x + 10 \\geq a > x\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n1. \\( a < -x + 10 \\)\n2. \\( a > x \\)\n\nCombining these inequalities, we have:\n\n\\[\nx < -x + 10\n\\]\n\nSolving this gives:\n\n\\[\n2x < 10 \\implies x < 5\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be an integer, the maximum integer value for \\( x \\) is \\( 4 \\).\n\nFinally, we check if \\( x = 4 \\) satisfies all conditions:\n\n1. If \\( x = 4 \\), then \\( r = -4 + 10 = 6 \\).\n2. Thus, \\( r = 6 \\) implies \\( a^2 + b^2 = 36 \\).\n3. We need \\( a > 4 \\) and \\( a < 6 \\) (since \\( a < -4 + 10 = 6 \\)).\n\nThis means \\( a \\) can be any value in the interval \\( (4, 6) \\), which is valid.\n\nThus, the maximum integer value that \\( x \\) can have is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } 4\n\\]"

            "To solve the original problem, we will follow a similar step-by-step approach as in the simplified problem.\n\n**Original Problem:**\nA point \\( P \\) is located inside an equilateral triangle \\( ABC \\) such that when lines are drawn from \\( P \\) to each of the vertices, the areas of the three resulting triangles \\( PAB \\), \\( PBC \\), and \\( PCA \\) are in the ratio 3:4:5. If the side length of the equilateral triangle \\( ABC \\) is \\( 12 \\), calculate the magnitude of the vector \\( \\mathbf{AP} + \\mathbf{BP} + \\mathbf{CP} \\).\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Denote the Areas:**\n   Let the areas of triangles \\( PAB \\), \\( PBC \\), and \\( PCA \\) be denoted as \\( S_1 \\), \\( S_2 \\), and \\( S_3 \\) respectively. According to the problem, these areas are in the ratio \\( S_1 : S_2 : S_3 = 3 : 4 : 5 \\).

            "To solve the original problem, we start by identifying the vertices of the triangle, which are at points \\( (0,0) \\), \\( (4,0) \\), and \\( (0,3) \\). The hypotenuse of the triangle connects the points \\( (4,0) \\) and \\( (0,3) \\). \n\nFirst, we find the equation of the line representing the hypotenuse. The slope of the line from \\( (4,0) \\) to \\( (0,3) \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{3 - 0}{0 - 4} = -\\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nUsing the point-slope form of the line equation with point \\( (4,0) \\):\n\n\\[\ny - 0 = -\\frac{3}{4}(x - 4) \\implies y = -\\frac{3}{4}x + 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the point where the logarithmic spiral intersects this line at an angle of \\( 45^\\circ \\) with respect to the horizontal axis. The angle \\( 45^\\circ \\) corresponds to a slope of \\( 1 \\) (since \\( \\tan(45^\\circ) = 1 \\)). Therefore, the line connecting the origin \\( (0,0) \\) to the intersection point must have a slope of \\( 1 \\).\n\nLet the intersection point be \\( (x, y) \\). Since the slope from the origin to this point is \\( 1 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y - 0}{x - 0} = 1 \\implies y = x\n\\]\n\nNow, we substitute \\( y = x \\) into the equation of the hypotenuse:\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{3}{4}x + 3\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx + \\frac{3}{4}x = 3 \\implies \\frac{7}{4}x = 3 \\implies x = \\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{7} = \\frac{12}{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( y = \\frac{12}{7} \\) as well, and the intersection point is \\( \\left(\\frac{12}{7}, \\frac{12}{7}\\right) \\).\n\nNext, we need to express the point \\( \\left(\\frac{12}{7}, \\frac{12}{7}\\right) \\) in polar coordinates. The polar coordinates \\( (r, \\theta) \\) are given by:\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{12}{7}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{12}{7}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{12}{7}\\right)^2} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7}\n\\]\n\nThe angle \\( \\theta \\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have the point \\( \\left(\\frac{12}{7}, \\frac{12}{7}\\right) \\) in polar coordinates as \\( \\left(r, \\theta\\right) = \\left(\\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\).\n\nThe equation of the logarithmic spiral is given by:\n\n\\[\nr = ae^{b\\theta}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the polar coordinates of the intersection point into the spiral equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7} = ae^{b \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( b \\), we need to express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\).

            "To solve the original problem, we start by identifying the vertices of the triangle, which are at points \\( (0,0) \\), \\( (4,0) \\), and \\( (0,3) \\).

Therefore, the dimensions of the remaining garden will be:\n   - Length: \\( 40 - 2x \\)\n   - Width: \\( 30 - 2x \\)\n\n5. **Calculate the area of the remaining garden**:\n   The area of the remaining garden can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of the remaining garden} = (40 - 2x)(30 - 2x)\n   \\]\n   We set this equal to the area of the remaining garden we calculated earlier:\n   \\[\n   (40 - 2x)(30 - 2x) = 600\n   \\]\n\n6. **Expand and simplify the equation**:\n   Expanding the left side:\n   \\[\n   1200 - 80x - 60x + 4x^2 = 600\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   4x^2 - 140x + 1200 = 600\n   \\]\n   Subtracting 600 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   4x^2 - 140x + 600 = 0\n   \\]\n\n7. **Divide the entire equation by 4**:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 35x + 150 = 0\n   \\]\n\n8. **Use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   The quadratic formula is given by:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -35 \\), and \\( c = 150 \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{35 \\pm \\sqrt{(-35)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 150}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{35 \\pm \\sqrt{1225 - 600}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{35 \\pm \\sqrt{625}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{35 \\pm 25}{2}\n   \\]\n\n9. **Calculate the two possible values for \\( x \\)**:\n   We have two potential solutions:\n   \\[\n   x_1 = \\frac{60}{2} = 30, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n   \\]\n   Since \\( x \\) must be a positive width, we will consider both values but check if they are valid within the dimensions of the garden.\n\n10. **Evaluate the solutions**:\n   The maximum possible width \\( x \\) must be less than half of the smaller dimension of the garden (30 meters), so \\( x < 15 \\). We can see that:\n   - \\( x_1 = 30 \\) is not valid as it exceeds the maximum possible width.\n   - \\( x_2 = 5 \\) is valid.\n\n11. **Conclusion**:\n   The width of the path that consumes exactly half of the garden's area is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{5 \\, \\text{meters}}\n   \\]"
