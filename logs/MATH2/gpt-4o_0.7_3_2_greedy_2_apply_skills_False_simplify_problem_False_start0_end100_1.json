To do this, list the sequences starting from each section and ensure that the sequence respects the color and the bead count pattern:\n\n1. Start with the 2 red beads: Only possible 6-bead sequence is 2 red beads + 4 blue beads.\n2. Start with the 4 blue beads: Possible sequences are within the blue section, or 4 blue beads + 2 green beads.\n3. Start with the 8 green beads: Possible sequences can be 6 beads from the green section or 8 green beads + 2 red beads from the next section.\n\nContinue this logic considering the transitions between each colored section based on the pattern of powers of 2, and identify all possible sequences of 6 beads.\n\nFinally, count the distinct color sequences formed by these 6 beads in the repeating pattern (e.g., RRB, RBB, BBR, etc.) to determine how many unique bracelets can be made.\n\nCount the total number of such unique combinations to find the answer."

                    "To solve the problem, let's begin by calculating the total number of ways to choose any two patches from the 63 available patches.\n\nThe garden is divided into square patches of 7x7 feet, so the dimensions of the garden in terms of patches are 9 x 7 (since \\( 63 \\div 7 = 9 \\) and \\( 49 \\div 7 = 7 \\)). Therefore, there are 63 patches in total.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of ways to choose any two patches:\n\n\\[ \\binom{63}{2} = \\frac{63 \\times 62}{2} = 1953. \\]\n\nNow, we need to count the number of ways two patches can touch each other either by the side or by the corner.\n\n1. **Side-adjacent patches:**\n   - Horizontally: There are 9 rows and each row has 8 possible horizontal touching pairs. So, \\( 9 \\times 8 = 72 \\) pairs.\n   - Vertically: There are 7 columns and each column has 8 possible vertical touching pairs. So, \\( 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\) pairs.\n   - Total side-adjacent pairs = 72 + 56 = 128.\n\n2. **Corner-adjacent patches:**\n   - Each inner 8 x 6 grid (since touching at corners requires a 2x2 block) has 4 possible corner touching pairs, and there are 8 such rows and 6 such columns, adding up to \\( 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\) corner-adjacent pairs.\n\nSo, the total number of touching pairs (either by side or corner) is \\( 128 + 48 = 176 \\).\n\nFinally, subtract the touching pairs from the total pairs to get the number of ways to plant roses and mint so they both thrive:\n\n\\[ 1953 - 176 = 1777. \\]\n\nAnswer: 1777"

                    "To find the number of ways two patches can touch each other, we consider two cases: patches that touch by sharing a side and patches that touch by sharing a corner.\n\n1. **Sharing a Side:**  \n   - For patches to share a horizontal side, there are 8 rows and 9 possible pairs in each row (since each row has 9 patches). Therefore, there are \\(8 \\times 9 = 72\\) such pairs.\n   - For patches to share a vertical side, there are 7 columns and 10 possible pairs in each column (since each column has 8 patches). Therefore, there are \\(7 \\times 10 = 70\\) such pairs.\n\n2. **Sharing a Corner:**\n   - There are 8 rows and 9 columns, so there are \\(8 \\times 9 = 72\\) interior corners. Each corner is shared by four patches, but it results in diagonally touching pairs of patches. Each pair is counted once per corner.\n\nSumming these, the total number of touching pairs is \\(72 + 70 + 72 = 214\\).\n\nNow, subtract the number of touching pairs from the total number of combinations:\n\n\\[ \n1953 - 214 = 1739 \n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to plant the patches such that they do not touch each other is \\(1739\\).\n\nAnswer: 1739",

            "To solve the problem, let's begin by calculating the total number of ways to choose any two patches from the 63 available patches.\n\nThe garden is divided into square patches of 7x7 feet, so the dimensions of the garden in terms of patches are 9 x 7 (since \\( 63 \\div 7 = 9 \\) and \\( 49 \\div 7 = 7 \\)). Therefore, there are 63 patches in total.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of ways to choose any two patches:\n\n\\[ \\binom{63}{2} = \\frac{63 \\times 62}{2} = 1953. \\]\n\nNow, we need to count the number of ways two patches can touch each other either by the side or by the corner.\n\n1. **Side-adjacent patches:**\n   - Horizontally: There are 9 rows and each row has 8 possible horizontal touching pairs. So, \\( 9 \\times 8 = 72 \\) pairs.\n   - Vertically: There are 7 columns and each column has 8 possible vertical touching pairs. So, \\( 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\) pairs.\n   - Total side-adjacent pairs = 72 + 56 = 128.\n\n2. **Corner-adjacent patches:**\n   - Each inner 8 x 6 grid (since touching at corners requires a 2x2 block) has 4 possible corner touching pairs, and there are 8 such rows and 6 such columns, adding up to \\( 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\) corner-adjacent pairs.\n\nSo, the total number of touching pairs (either by side or corner) is \\( 128 + 48 = 176 \\).\n\nFinally, subtract the touching pairs from the total pairs to get the number of ways to plant roses and mint so they both thrive:\n\n\\[ 1953 - 176 = 1777. \\]\n\nAnswer: 1777"

Thus, along the width of 10 meters, the number of whole tiles that fit is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number along width} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{10 \\times \\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nSimilarly, along the length of 20 meters:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number along length} = \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{2}} = 10\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nSince only whole tiles can be used, we take the floor of these values:\n\n\\[ \\lfloor 5\\sqrt{2} \\rfloor = 7 \\]\n\n\\[ \\lfloor 10\\sqrt{2} \\rfloor = 14 \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of tiles:**\n\nThe total number of tiles that can be placed is:\n\n\\[ 7 \\times 14 = 98 \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total tiled area:**\n\nSince each tile covers 1 square meter, the total area covered by tiles is 98 square meters.\n\n4. **Calculate the grassy area:**\n\nThe total area of the field is 200 square meters. Therefore, the grassy area, which is the area not covered by tiles, is:\n\n\\[ 200 - 98 = 102 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nAnswer: 102"

            "To calculate the number of tiles that fit along each dimension, we first need to determine the effective number of tiles that fit along the width and length of the field when the tiles are placed at a 45-degree angle.\n\n1.

Adjusting for the constraints again:\n\nThe calculation should indeed be reassessed for diagonal placement and re-evaluate.

                    "First step: Identify the smallest positive square-free integer greater than 1 and check if it can be expressed as a sum of three distinct prime numbers.\n\nTo begin, we look for the smallest square-free integer greater than 1. A square-free integer is one that is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1. The smallest such integer is 2. However, 2 cannot be expressed as a sum of three distinct primes because the smallest prime is 2, and adding two more primes will exceed 2.\n\nNext, we consider the next square-free integer, which is 3. Similarly, 3 cannot be expressed as a sum of three distinct prime numbers because the smallest prime is 2, and adding two more primes will exceed 3.\n\nWe continue this process by checking subsequent square-free integers:\n\n1. 4 is not square-free (since 4 = 2^2).\n2. 5 is square-free, and we check if it can be expressed as a sum of three distinct primes. The smallest primes are 2, 3, 5, but 2 + 3 + 5 = 10, which exceeds 5.\n3. 6 is square-free, and similarly, we cannot express it as a sum of three distinct primes because it exceeds 6.\n\nContinue this process up to 30:\n\n- For 6: 2 + 3 + a third prime, but 2 + 3 = 5, and the next prime is 5, which cannot be distinct.\n- For 7: 2 + 3 + a third prime, but 2 + 3 = 5, and the next prime is 5, which cannot be distinct.\n- For 8: 2 + 3 + a third prime, but 2 + 3 = 5, and the next prime is 5, which cannot be distinct.\n- For 9: not square-free (since 9 = 3^2).\n- For 10: 2 + 3 + a third prime, but 2 + 3 = 5, and the next prime is 5, which cannot be distinct.\n- For 11: 2 + 3 + a third prime, but 2 + 3 = 5, and the next prime is 5, which cannot be distinct.\n- For 12: 2 + 3 + a third prime, but 2 + 3 = 5, and the next prime is 5, which cannot be distinct.\n- For 13: 2 + 3 + 7 = 12 < 13, and primes are distinct. However, 13 - 2 - 3 = 8, which is not a prime.\n- For 14: 2 + 3 + 7 = 12 < 14, and primes are distinct. However, 14 - 2 - 3 = 9, which is not a prime.\n- For 15: 2 + 3 + 7 = 12 < 15, and primes are distinct. However, 15 - 2 - 3 = 10, which is not a prime.\n- For 17: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 < 17, and 17 - 2 - 3 = 12, which is not a prime.\n- For 19: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 < 19, and 19 - 2 - 3 = 14, which is not a prime.\n- For 21: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 < 21, and 21 - 2 - 3 = 16, which is not a prime.\n- For 22: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 < 22, and 22 - 2 - 3 = 17, which is a prime, distinct from 2 and 3.\n\nThus, n = 22 is square-free, and 22 = 2 + 3 + 17, with 2, 3, and 17 being distinct primes.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive square-free integer n greater than 1 such that given n coins we can arrange them into three piles each with a distinct prime number of coins is n = 22."

To do this, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.\n\nThe complex conjugate of \\( -3 - 4i \\) is \\( -3 + 4i \\).\n\nFirst, compute the product of the numerator and the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n\\[\n(14 + 23i)(-3 + 4i) = 14(-3) + 14(4i) + 23i(-3) + 23i(4i)\n\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n\\[\n14(-3) = -42\n\\]\n\\[\n14(4i) = 56i\n\\]\n\\[\n23i(-3) = -69i\n\\]\n\\[\n23i(4i) = 92i^2\n\\]\n\nSince \\(i^2 = -1\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n92i^2 = -92\n\\]\n\nNow, combine all the terms:\n\n\\[\n-42 + 56i - 69i - 92 = -134 - 13i\n\\]\n\nNext, compute the product of the denominator and its conjugate:\n\n\\[\n(-3 - 4i)(-3 + 4i) = (-3)^2 - (4i)^2 = 9 - 16i^2\n\\]\n\nSince \\(i^2 = -1\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n16i^2 = -16\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n9 - (-16) = 9 + 16 = 25\n\\]\n\nNow, divide the result of the numerator by the result of the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-134 - 13i}{25} = -\\frac{134}{25} - \\frac{13}{25}i\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the original expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } -\\frac{134}{25} - \\frac{13}{25}i\n\\]"
