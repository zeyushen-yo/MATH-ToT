            "Possible next step:\n\n### **2. Divisibility by 15**\n\nTo ensure that the sum of the 5 consecutive integers is **not** divisible by 15, we need to determine the conditions under which the sum \\( S = 5n + 10 \\) is **not** divisible by 15.\n\n#### **Step 2.1: Determine When the Sum Is Divisible by 15**\n\nFirst, let's find when the sum \\( S = 5n + 10 \\) is divisible by 15:\n\n\\[\n5n + 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{15}\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n5n \\equiv -10 \\pmod{15}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(-10 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{15}\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n5n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{15}\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 5 (which is permissible since 5 and 15 are not coprime, but we'll adjust accordingly):\n\n\\[\nn \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\n#### **Step 2.2: Apply the Non-Divisibility Condition**\n\nWe want the sum **not** to be divisible by 15. Therefore, \\( n \\) should **not** satisfy the above condition:\n\n\\[\nn \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\nThis means \\( n \\) can be congruent to either 0 or 2 modulo 3:\n\n\\[\nn \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\n#### **Step 2.3: Combine with Previous Condition (Even \\( n \\))**\n\nFrom **Step 1**, we have established that \\( n \\) must be even:\n\n\\[\nn \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\n\\]\n\nCombining this with the conditions from **Step 2.2**, \\( n \\) must satisfy both:\n\n\\[\nn \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n \\equiv 0 \\text{ or } 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\nThis can be combined into a single congruence modulo 6:\n\n\\[\nn \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\n\n#### **Step 2.4: Count the Valid \\( n \\) Values**\n\nWe need to find all even integers \\( n \\) within the first 100 natural numbers such that \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 2 \\pmod{6} \\).\n\nSince we are choosing 5 consecutive integers from the first 100 natural numbers, the starting number \\( n \\) can range from 1 to 96 (because \\( n + 4 \\leq 100 \\)).\n\n1. **Numbers congruent to 0 modulo 6:**\n   \\[\n   n = 6, 12, 18, \\ldots, 96\n   \\]\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{96}{6} = 16 \\)\n\n2. **Numbers congruent to 2 modulo 6:**\n   \\[\n   n = 2, 8, 14, \\ldots, 92\n   \\]\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{92 - 2}{6} + 1 = 16 \\)\n\n**Total valid \\( n \\) values:** \\( 16 + 16 = 32 \\)\n\n#### **Step 2.5: Conclusion**\n\nThere are **32** valid starting integers \\( n \\) that satisfy both conditions:\n- The sum of the 5 consecutive integers is divisible by 10.\n- The sum is **not** divisible by 15.\n\n### **Answer:** 32"
