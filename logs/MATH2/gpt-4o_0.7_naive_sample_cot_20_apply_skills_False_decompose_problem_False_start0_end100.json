This means if you start at position 1, the ball goes to position 2, then to position 3, and so on, wrapping around to position 1 after position 10.\n\n2. **Passing the Ball**: The ball is passed exactly 9 times. We need to determine if the ball will return to the starting person after these 9 passes.\n\n3. **Circle Logic**: When the ball is passed 9 times in a circle of 10 people, we can model this as modular arithmetic. If the ball starts at position 1 (without loss of generality), after 9 passes, it will be at position (1 + 9) mod 10.\n\n4. **Calculation**: \n   \\[\n   (1 + 9) \\mod 10 = 10 \\mod 10 = 0\n   \\]\n   In modular arithmetic for this problem, position 0 is equivalent to position 10, which is the same as position 1 in a circle. Therefore, after 9 passes, the ball returns to the starting position.\n\n5. **Probability**: Since the ball will always return to the starting position after 9 passes irrespective of the starting point, the probability that the ball returns to the starting person is 1.\n\nThus, the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times is 1.\n\nAnswer: 1",

We want to determine the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Position:** Let's label the starting person as person 0. The people are then labeled 0 through 9 in a clockwise direction.\n\n2. **Passes:** Every time the ball is passed to the right, it moves to the next person in the sequence. \n\n3. **Total Passes:** We need the ball to return to person 0 after exactly 9 passes.\n\n4. **Circular Arrangement:** Since the friends are sitting in a circle, passing the ball 10 times would bring it back to the starting person (0, in this case). Therefore, in order for the ball to return to person 0 after 9 passes, the ball must have been passed to every other person, except person 0, exactly 9 times.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation:** Since there are 10 people, and we're passing the ball 9 times, the ball's final position after 9 passes will be calculated as follows:\n   - Starting at person 0, after 9 passes, the ball will be at position \\( (0 + 9) \\mod 10 = 9 \\mod 10 = 9 \\).\n   - This means the ball will be with person 9, not person 0.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** Since after 9 passes the ball is not with person 0, it is impossible for the ball to return to the starting person after exactly 9 passes.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Answer: } 0 \\]",
