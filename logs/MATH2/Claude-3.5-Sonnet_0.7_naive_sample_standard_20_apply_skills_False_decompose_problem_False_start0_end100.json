Let's call the length of the path 'h'.\n\n3) If we draw this height 'h', it divides the hypotenuse (100 feet) into two parts.\n   Let's call these parts 'x' and '(100-x)'.\n\n4) By similar triangles:\n   * x/60 = 48/80\n   * x = (60 \u00d7 48)/80 = 36\n\n5) Now I can find 'h' using the Pythagorean theorem in either of the smaller triangles:\n   * h\u00b2 + 36\u00b2 = 60\u00b2\n   * h\u00b2 = 3600 - 1296\n   * h\u00b2 = 2304\n   * h = 48\n\n6) Now, I need to find how many lights will fit on a 48-foot path when placed 5 feet apart, starting at the right angle.\n\n7) Number of lights = (Length of path \u00f7 Distance between lights) + 1\n   * Number of lights = (48 \u00f7 5) + 1\n   * Number of lights = 9.6 + 1\n   * Number of lights = 10 + 1\n   * Number of lights = 11\n\nThe +1 is needed because we start counting from 0 feet (at the right angle).\n\nAnswer: 11",
            "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's recall that this is a right triangle with:\n   * One leg = 60 feet\n   * Other leg = 80 feet\n   * Hypotenuse = 100 feet\n\n2) The path starts at the right angle and goes straight to the hypotenuse. To find the length of this path, we need to find its height (h).\n\n3) We can use similar triangles to find the height:\n   * Let's call the height h\n   * Area of triangle can be found in two ways:\n     * (1/2) \u00d7 60 \u00d7 80 = (1/2) \u00d7 100 \u00d7 h\n\n4) Therefore:\n   * 2400 = 50h\n   * h = 48 feet\n\n5) Now we know that:\n   * The path is 48 feet long\n   * Lights need to be placed every 5 feet\n   * First light is at the start (at 0 feet)\n\n6) To find number of lights:\n   * Number of intervals = 48 \u00f7 5 = 9.6\n   * Since we start counting at 0 and need a light at both ends:\n   * Number of lights = number of intervals + 1\n   * Number of lights = 10\n\nTherefore, 10 lights will be needed.\n\nAnswer: 10",
