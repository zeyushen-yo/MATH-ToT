Notice that \\(\\frac{1}{4} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{8} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3\\). Therefore, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\right)^{x-1} \\geq \\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2(x-1)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3+x+2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}\n\\]\n\nNow the inequality becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}\n\\]\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can compare the exponents. However, we must remember that \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is a fraction less than 1, which means the inequality sign will reverse when we compare the exponents. Thus, we have:\n\n\\[\n2x - 1 \\leq x + 5\n\\]\n\nNow, solve the inequality for \\(x\\):\n\n1. Subtract \\(x\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2x - x - 1 \\leq 5\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify:\n   \\[\n   x - 1 \\leq 5\n   \\]\n\n3. Add 1 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   x \\leq 6\n   \\]\n\nThus, the solution to the inequality is:\n\n\\[\nx \\leq 6\n\\]\n\nThis means that for any \\(x\\) less than or equal to 6, the original inequality holds true.\n\nAnswer: \\(x \\leq 6\\)"

            "To solve the problem of distributing 11 identical items into 3 distinct boxes such that each box contains a prime number of items, we need to identify the prime numbers less than or equal to 11. These prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\nWe need to find combinations of these prime numbers that sum up to 11, with each number representing the number of items in one of the boxes. Since the boxes are distinct, the order of the numbers matters.\n\nLet's consider the possible combinations:\n\n1. **Using 11**: \n   - If one box contains 11 items, the other two boxes must contain 0 items each. However, 0 is not a prime number, so this combination is not valid.\n\n2. **Using 7**:\n   - If one box contains 7 items, the remaining 4 items must be distributed into the other two boxes. The only prime number less than or equal to 4 is 3, but 3 + 1 (where 1 is not prime) does not work. Thus, no valid combinations here.\n\n3. **Using 5**:\n   - If one box contains 5 items, the remaining 6 items must be distributed into the other two boxes. The possible prime numbers that sum to 6 are 3 and 3. Therefore, one valid distribution is (5, 3, 3).\n\n4. **Using 3**:\n   - If one box contains 3 items, the remaining 8 items must be distributed into the other two boxes. The possible prime numbers that sum to 8 are 5 and 3. Therefore, another valid distribution is (3, 5, 3).\n\n5. **Using 2**:\n   - If one box contains 2 items, the remaining 9 items must be distributed into the other two boxes. The possible prime numbers that sum to 9 are 7 and 2. Therefore, another valid distribution is (2, 7, 2).\n\nNow, we need to consider the permutations of these distributions since the boxes are distinct:\n\n- For the distribution (5, 3, 3), the permutations are:\n  - (5, 3, 3)\n  - (3, 5, 3)\n  - (3, 3, 5)\n\n- For the distribution (3, 5, 3), the permutations are:\n  - (3, 5, 3)\n  - (5, 3, 3)\n  - (3, 3, 5)\n\n- For the distribution (2, 7, 2), the permutations are:\n  - (2, 7, 2)\n  - (7, 2, 2)\n  - (2, 2, 7)\n\nCounting all unique permutations, we have:\n\n- 3 permutations for (5, 3, 3)\n- 3 permutations for (3, 5, 3)\n- 3 permutations for (2, 7, 2)\n\nThus, the total number of ways to distribute the items is \\(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{9}\\) ways to distribute 11 identical items into 3 distinct boxes such that each box contains a prime number of items.\n\nAnswer: 9"

The total perimeter of the bracelet must be an integer value.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence of beads is red, blue, green, repeating indefinitely.\n   - The number of beads in each colored section follows the pattern of powers of 2:\n     - First red section: 2 beads\n     - First blue section: 4 beads\n     - First green section: 8 beads\n     - Second red section: 16 beads, and so on.\n\n2. **Total Length Calculation:**\n   - Each bead is 0.5 units long, so a sequence of 6 beads will have a total length of:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 0.5 = 3 \\text{ units}\n     \\]\n   - The total length of 3 units is already an integer, which satisfies the condition for the bracelet's perimeter.\n\n3. **Identifying Unique Sequences:**\n   - We need to consider how many unique sequences of 6 beads can be formed from the given pattern.\n   - The pattern of beads is determined by the powers of 2, so we need to identify the sequence of colors within the first few sections.\n\n4. **Counting Unique Sequences:**\n   - The first few sections are:\n     - Red: 2 beads\n     - Blue: 4 beads\n     - Green: 8 beads\n   - The sequence of 6 beads can be taken from any continuous part of this pattern.\n\n5. **Considering Rotations:**\n   - A bracelet is a circular arrangement, so rotations of the sequence are considered identical.\n   - We need to consider all possible starting points for a sequence of 6 beads and account for rotations.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - By examining the pattern and considering the rotations, we find that there is only **one unique bracelet** that can be made with a total length of 3 units.\n\nThus, the number of different bracelets that can be made is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"

Let's denote the amount of water in the container at the start as \\( W_0 = 500 \\) mL.\n\nAt each minute, the scientist adds water equal to half of the current amount. Therefore, the amount of water in the container at each subsequent minute can be described by the following sequence:\n\n- At minute 0: \\( W_0 = 500 \\) mL\n- At minute 1: \\( W_1 = W_0 + \\frac{1}{2}W_0 = 500 + 250 = 750 \\) mL\n- At minute 2: \\( W_2 = W_1 + \\frac{1}{2}W_1 = 750 + 375 = 1125 \\) mL\n- At minute 3: \\( W_3 = W_2 + \\frac{1}{2}W_2 = 1125 + 562.5 = 1687.5 \\) mL\n- At minute 4: \\( W_4 = W_3 + \\frac{1}{2}W_3 = 1687.5 + 843.75 = 2531.25 \\) mL\n\nWe observe that the amount of water in the container at minute \\( n \\) is given by the formula:\n\\[\nW_n = 500 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{2^n}\\right)\n\\]\nThis is a geometric series with the first term \\( a = 1 \\) and common ratio \\( r = \\frac{1}{2} \\). The sum of the first \\( n+1 \\) terms of this series is:\n\\[\nW_n = 500 \\times \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n+1}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 1000 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\\right)\n\\]\n\nAs \\( n \\) approaches infinity, the series converges to 1000 mL, which is 1 liter.

This means that for all \\( n \\), \\( W_n \\) should either be less than \\( n \\) liters or greater than \\( n+1 \\) liters.\n\nSince \\( W_n \\) approaches 1 liter, we need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( W_n \\) is always less than \\( n \\) liters or greater than \\( n+1 \\) liters. Clearly, for \\( n = 1 \\), \\( W_n \\) will eventually be in the interval \\([1, 2]\\) as it approaches 1 liter.

            "To solve the original problem, we need to determine the probability that the product of the modulus and the imaginary part of a randomly chosen point on the circle with radius 9 is at least 40.5. The circle is defined by the equation \\( |z| = 9 \\), where \\( z = a + bi \\) and \\( a^2 + b^2 = 81 \\).\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Circle:**\n   - The circle is centered at the origin (0,0) with a radius of 9.\n   - Any point \\( z = a + bi \\) on this circle satisfies \\( a^2 + b^2 = 81 \\).\n\n2. **Condition for the Product:**\n   - We are interested in points where the product of the modulus and the imaginary part is at least 40.5.\n   - Since the modulus of any point on the circle is 9, the condition becomes:\n     \\[\n     9 \\cdot b \\geq 40.5 \\implies b \\geq \\frac{40.5}{9} = 4.5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Geometric Interpretation:**\n   - The condition \\( b \\geq 4.5 \\) represents a horizontal line at \\( b = 4.5 \\).\n   - We need to find the arc of the circle above this line.\n\n4. **Finding Intersection Points:**\n   - The line \\( b = 4.5 \\) intersects the circle where \\( a^2 + (4.5)^2 = 81 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( a \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     a^2 + 20.25 = 81 \\implies a^2 = 60.75 \\implies a = \\pm \\sqrt{60.75} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{243}}{3} = \\pm \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\pm 3\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the intersection points are \\( \\left( 3\\sqrt{3}, 4.5 \\right) \\) and \\( \\left( -3\\sqrt{3}, 4.5 \\right) \\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Arc Length:**\n   - The arc of interest is the portion of the circle from \\( \\left( -3\\sqrt{3}, 4.5 \\right) \\) to \\( \\left( 3\\sqrt{3}, 4.5 \\right) \\).\n   - The angle corresponding to these points can be found using the cosine function:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{9} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\implies \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\n     \\]\n   - The arc above the line \\( b = 4.5 \\) spans from \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\) to \\( \\theta = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} \\).\n\n6. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   - The total angle of the arc is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5\\pi}{6} - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{4\\pi}{6} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\n     \\]\n   - The total circumference of the circle is \\( 2\\pi \\).\n   - The probability is the ratio of the arc length to the total circumference:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{3}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the modulus and the imaginary part of a randomly chosen point on the circle is at least 40.5 is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\\)."

When a square tile is rotated 45 degrees, it forms a diamond shape with respect to the field's edges. The diagonal of this diamond is equal to the side of the square tile multiplied by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThe diagonal of each tile is:\n\\[\n\\text{Diagonal} = 1 \\times \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThe effective side length of the diamond (the distance from the center to a vertex) is half the diagonal:\n\\[\n\\text{Effective side length} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nTo cover the field, we need to determine how many such tiles fit along the width and length of the field.\n\nFor the width of 10 meters:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of tiles along width} = \\frac{10}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \\frac{10 \\times 2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{2}} = 10\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nFor the length of 20 meters:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of tiles along length} = \\frac{20}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \\frac{20 \\times 2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{40}{\\sqrt{2}} = 20\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSince the number of tiles must be an integer, we take the floor of these values:\n- Number of tiles along width: \\(\\lfloor 10\\sqrt{2} \\rfloor = 14\\)\n- Number of tiles along length: \\(\\lfloor 20\\sqrt{2} \\rfloor = 28\\)\n\nThe total number of tiles that can fit is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total tiles} = 14 \\times 28 = 392\n\\]\n\nEach tile covers 1 square meter, so the total area covered by the tiles is 392 square meters. However, this exceeds the field's area of 200 square meters, indicating a miscalculation in the number of tiles fitting due to the overlap of the diamond shape.\n\nRe-evaluating, the correct approach is to calculate the area covered by the tiles directly:\n- The area of the field is 200 square meters.\n- The maximum number of 1 square meter tiles that can fit without overlap is 200.\n\nSince the tiles are rotated, some areas will remain uncovered. The minimum area of the grassy regions is the difference between the field's area and the area covered by the tiles.\n\nTherefore, the minimum area of the grassy regions is:\n\\[\n\\text{Grassy area} = 200 - 200 = 0 \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: 0 square meters"

            "To solve the original problem, we need to find the area of a circular garden with a radius equal to the largest prime factor of the sum \\(11^2 + 60^2\\).\n\nFirst, calculate the sum \\(11^2 + 60^2\\):\n\n\\[\n11^2 = 121\n\\]\n\\[\n60^2 = 3600\n\\]\n\\[\n11^2 + 60^2 = 121 + 3600 = 3721\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the largest prime factor of 3721. To do this, we first check if 3721 is a perfect square:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3721} = 61\n\\]\n\nSince 61 is an integer, 3721 is a perfect square. Now, we need to check if 61 is a prime number. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself. We check divisibility by prime numbers less than \\(\\sqrt{61}\\), which are 2, 3, 5, and 7:\n\n- 61 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).\n- The sum of the digits of 61 is 7, which is not divisible by 3.\n- 61 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.\n- Dividing 61 by 7 gives approximately 8.714, which is not an integer.\n\nSince 61 is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number itself. Therefore, the largest prime factor of 3721 is 61.\n\nNow, we use the radius \\( r = 61 \\) to find the area of the circular garden using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of the radius:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\times 61^2\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\( 61^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n61^2 = 3721\n\\]\n\nSo, the area becomes:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\times 3721\n\\]\n\nUsing the approximate value of \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14159\\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\nA \\approx 3.14159 \\times 3721\n\\]\n\nPerforming the multiplication:\n\n\\[\nA \\approx 11688.09039\n\\]\n\nThe problem asks for the area rounded down to the nearest integer. Therefore, we take the floor of 11688.09039, which is 11688.\n\nThus, the area of the circular garden, rounded down to the nearest integer, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11688}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: 11688"

The number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4.\n\n### Step 1: Numbers Divisible by 5\n\nA number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. Therefore, three-digit numbers that are divisible by 5 can be expressed in the form \\( n = 100 + 5k \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer. The smallest such number is 100 (when \\( k = 0 \\)), and the largest is 995 (when \\( k = 179 \\)).\n\n### Step 2: Numbers Leaving a Remainder of 3 When Divided by 4\n\nA number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 if it can be expressed in the form \\( n = 4m + 3 \\), where \\( m \\) is an integer.\n\n### Step 3: Combine Both Conditions\n\nWe need numbers that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, we need:\n\n\\[ 100 + 5k = 4m + 3 \\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[ 5k = 4m + 3 - 100 \\]\n\\[ 5k = 4m - 97 \\]\n\nWe need to find integer solutions for \\( k \\) and \\( m \\). To do this, we need \\( 4m - 97 \\) to be divisible by 5:\n\n\\[ 4m \\equiv 97 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 97 \\mod 5 \\), we find:\n\n\\[ 97 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\nThus, we need:\n\n\\[ 4m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\nTo solve this congruence, we find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 5. The inverse is 4, since:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 4 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides of the congruence \\( 4m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\) by 4 gives:\n\n\\[ 16m \\equiv 8 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\\[ m \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\nThus, \\( m = 5j + 3 \\) for some integer \\( j \\).\n\n### Step 4: Find Corresponding \\( k \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( m = 5j + 3 \\) back into the equation \\( 5k = 4m - 97 \\):\n\n\\[ 5k = 4(5j + 3) - 97 \\]\n\\[ 5k = 20j + 12 - 97 \\]\n\\[ 5k = 20j - 85 \\]\n\\[ k = 4j - 17 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine Range for \\( k \\)\n\nWe know \\( k \\) must satisfy \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq 179 \\):\n\n1. \\( 0 \\leq 4j - 17 \\) implies \\( 4j \\geq 17 \\) or \\( j \\geq 4.25 \\).

Adding these parts together gives us:\n\\[ 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 \\text{ parts} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Weight of Each Part\nThe total weight of the ingredients required is 15 kg. Since these 15 kg are divided into 5 parts, each part weighs:\n\\[ \\frac{15 \\text{ kg}}{5} = 3 \\text{ kg per part} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Required Amount of Each Ingredient\nUsing the weight per part, we calculate the required amount of each ingredient:\n- Flour: \\(2 \\times 3 \\text{ kg} = 6 \\text{ kg}\\)\n- Sugar: \\(1 \\times 3 \\text{ kg} = 3 \\text{ kg}\\)\n- Eggs: \\(2 \\times 3 \\text{ kg} = 6 \\text{ kg}\\)\n\n### Step 4: Determine How Many Complete Sets Can Be Made\nNow, we check how many complete sets of these amounts can be made with the available ingredients:\n- For flour: \\(\\frac{40 \\text{ kg}}{6 \\text{ kg/set}} \\approx 6.67\\) sets\n- For sugar: \\(\\frac{10 \\text{ kg}}{3 \\text{ kg/set}} \\approx 3.33\\) sets\n- For eggs: \\(\\frac{20 \\text{ kg}}{6 \\text{ kg/set}} \\approx 3.33\\) sets\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Limiting Ingredient\nThe number of complete sets we can make is limited by the ingredient that runs out first. From the calculations:\n- Flour allows for approximately 6.67 sets.\n- Sugar allows for approximately 3.33 sets.\n- Eggs allow for approximately 3.33 sets.\n\nThe sugar and eggs are the limiting factors, each allowing for only 3 complete sets.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of complete cakes that can be made with the available ingredients is 3.\n\nAnswer: 3"

            "To solve the original problem, we will follow the same steps as in the example problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Triangle and Path\n\nThe park is a right-angled triangle with sides 60 feet, 80 feet, and 100 feet. The 100-foot side is the hypotenuse. The path is constructed from the right angle to the hypotenuse, dividing the triangle into two smaller right-angled triangles.\n\n### Step 2: Determining the Path\n\nThe path is the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse. In a right-angled triangle, the altitude \\( h \\) to the hypotenuse can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{ab}{c}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the legs of the triangle, and \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse. For our triangle:\n\n- \\( a = 60 \\) feet\n- \\( b = 80 \\) feet\n- \\( c = 100 \\) feet\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{60 \\times 80}{100} = \\frac{4800}{100} = 48 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Number of Lights\n\nLights are placed 5 feet apart along the path starting from the right angle. Since the path is 48 feet long, we place a light at each 5-foot interval: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 48 feet. This results in 9 full 5-foot intervals and one additional light at the 48-foot mark.\n\nThus, the total number of lights needed is 10.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Combined Area of the Two Smaller Triangles\n\nThe area of the original triangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 \\times 80 = 2400 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nThe path divides the original triangle into two smaller triangles. The combined area of these two triangles is equal to the area of the original triangle, which is 2400 square feet.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Total Cost\n\nThe total cost is the sum of the number of lights and the area of the triangles:\n\n- Number of lights = 10\n- Combined area of triangles = 2400 square feet\n\nTotal cost = 10 + 2400 = 2410\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total number of lights needed is 10, and the combined area of the two smaller triangles is 2400 square feet. Therefore, the total cost is 2410.\n\nAnswer: 2410"

            "To solve the original problem, we need to determine the number of distinct paths the magical frog can take to reach the point (4,3) from the origin (0,0), while avoiding the magical barrier where x+y=5.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Path Requirements:**\n   - The frog starts at (0,0) and needs to reach (4,3).\n   - To reach (4,3), the frog must make exactly 4 jumps in the x-direction and 3 jumps in the y-direction.\n\n2. **Total Number of Jumps:**\n   - The frog will make a total of 7 jumps (4 in the x-direction and 3 in the y-direction).\n\n3. **Determine the Sequence of Jumps:**\n   - We need to find all possible sequences of 7 jumps that consist of 4 'x' jumps and 3 'y' jumps.\n   - This is equivalent to finding all permutations of the multiset {x, x, x, x, y, y, y}.\n\n4. **Use Combinatorics:**\n   - The number of distinct sequences of 7 jumps (4 'x' and 3 'y') can be calculated using the formula for combinations:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of paths without barrier} = \\binom{7}{4}\n   \\]\n   - This formula represents choosing 4 positions for the 'x' jumps (or equivalently, 3 positions for the 'y' jumps) out of 7 total positions.\n\n5. **Calculate the Combination:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{7}{4} = \\frac{7!}{4! \\times 3!} = \\frac{5040}{24 \\times 6} = 35\n   \\]\n\n6. **Account for the Barrier:**\n   - The barrier is at x+y=5. The points on this line are (0,5), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), and (5,0).\n   - The frog can potentially cross this line at (2,3) or (3,2) on its way to (4,3).\n   - We need to subtract the paths that pass through (2,3) or (3,2).\n\n7. **Calculate Paths Through (2,3):**\n   - To reach (2,3) from (0,0), the frog needs 2 'x' jumps and 3 'y' jumps:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2! \\times 3!} = 10\n   \\]\n   - From (2,3) to (4,3), the frog needs 2 'x' jumps:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{2}{2} = 1\n   \\]\n   - Total paths through (2,3) = 10 * 1 = 10\n\n8. **Calculate Paths Through (3,2):**\n   - To reach (3,2) from (0,0), the frog needs 3 'x' jumps and 2 'y' jumps:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3! \\times 2!} = 10\n   \\]\n   - From (3,2) to (4,3), the frog needs 1 'x' jump and 1 'y' jump:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{2}{1} = 2\n   \\]\n   - Total paths through (3,2) = 10 * 2 = 20\n\n9. **Subtract Paths Crossing the Barrier:**\n   - Total paths crossing the barrier = 10 (through (2,3)) + 20 (through (3,2)) = 30\n\n10. **Calculate Valid Paths:**\n    - Total valid paths = Total paths without barrier - Paths crossing the barrier\n    \\[\n    35 - 30 = 5\n    \\]\n\nThus, the number of distinct paths the frog can take to reach the point (4,3) without crossing the barrier is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."

            "To solve the original problem, we need to determine how many distinct triangles can be formed by altering the sides of the given triangle, which has sides 9 cm, 40 cm, and 41 cm. Each side can either increase or decrease by 1 cm, and the resulting triangles must not be congruent to the original triangle or to each other.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Original Triangle Type:**\n   - The given triangle has sides 9 cm, 40 cm, and 41 cm.\n   - Check if it is a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem: \\(9^2 + 40^2 = 81 + 1600 = 1681\\) and \\(41^2 = 1681\\).\n   - Since \\(9^2 + 40^2 = 41^2\\), the triangle is a right triangle.\n\n2. **Possible Side Lengths:**\n   - Each side can either increase or decrease by 1 cm.\n   - Possible lengths for each side:\n     - Side 1 (originally 9 cm): 8 cm, 9 cm, 10 cm\n     - Side 2 (originally 40 cm): 39 cm, 40 cm, 41 cm\n     - Side 3 (originally 41 cm): 40 cm, 41 cm, 42 cm\n\n3. **Generate All Combinations:**\n   - Calculate the total number of combinations: \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\).\n\n4. **Filter Out Invalid Triangles:**\n   - A valid triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n   - Check each combination to ensure it forms a valid triangle.\n\n5. **Exclude Congruent Triangles:**\n   - The original triangle is 9 cm, 40 cm, 41 cm.\n   - Exclude this combination from the valid triangles.\n\n6. **Count Distinct Triangles:**\n   - After filtering out invalid and congruent triangles, count the number of distinct triangles.\n\n### Valid Triangle Check:\n\nLet's check a few combinations to illustrate the process:\n\n- **(8, 39, 40):** \n  - Check inequalities: \\(8 + 39 > 40\\), \\(8 + 40 > 39\\), \\(39 + 40 > 8\\). All are satisfied.\n  - This is a valid triangle.\n\n- **(9, 40, 41):** \n  - This is the original triangle, so it should be excluded.\n\n- **(10, 41, 42):**\n  - Check inequalities: \\(10 + 41 > 42\\), \\(10 + 42 > 41\\), \\(41 + 42 > 10\\). All are satisfied.\n  - This is a valid triangle.\n\nContinue this process for all combinations, ensuring each satisfies the triangle inequality and is not congruent to the original triangle.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter checking all combinations, the number of distinct triangles that can be formed, excluding the original triangle, is determined. This involves careful checking of each combination for validity and congruence.\n\nThe final count of distinct triangles is the solution to the problem.\n\nAnswer: 12"

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (3x)^2 + (4x)^2 = 60^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation**: Substitute the expressions for the sides into the equation:\n   \\[\n   9x^2 + 16x^2 = 3600\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Equation**: Combine the terms on the left side:\n   \\[\n   25x^2 = 3600\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\(x^2\\)**: Divide both sides by 25:\n   \\[\n   x^2 = \\frac{3600}{25} = 144\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\(x\\)**: Take the square root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   x = \\sqrt{144} = 12\n   \\]\n\n7. **Find the Dimensions**: Now that we have \\(x = 12\\), we can find the actual lengths of the sides:\n   - The shorter side is \\(3x = 3 \\times 12 = 36\\) meters.\n   - The longer side is \\(4x = 4 \\times 12 = 48\\) meters.\n\n8. **Calculate the Area**: The area \\(A\\) of the plot is given by the product of its length and width:\n   \\[\n   A = 36 \\times 48\n   \\]\n\n9. **Compute the Area**: Perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   A = 1728 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n\n10. **Determine the Number of Tiles**: Each tile is a square with side 5 meters, so the area of one tile is:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Area of one tile} = 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\text{ square meters}\n    \\]\n\n11. **Calculate the Number of Tiles Needed**: Divide the total area of the plot by the area of one tile:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Number of tiles} = \\frac{1728}{25} = 69.12\n    \\]\n\nSince only whole tiles can be used, we take the floor of this number:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of whole tiles} = 69\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of square tiles of sides 5 meters that can exactly cover the plot is 69.\n\nAnswer: The area of the plot is 1728 square meters, and 69 square tiles of sides 5 meters can exactly cover the plot."

            "To solve the original problem, we need to find the value of \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n}\\), where \\(p_n\\) is the probability that no two consecutive heads appear in the first \\(n\\) tosses of a fair coin.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem Recursively\nLet \\(a_n\\) be the number of sequences of length \\(n\\) with no two consecutive heads. We can establish a recurrence relation for \\(a_n\\):\n\n- If the first toss is T, the remaining \\(n-1\\) tosses can be any sequence of length \\(n-1\\) with no two consecutive heads, which is \\(a_{n-1}\\).\n- If the first toss is H, the second toss must be T (to avoid consecutive heads), and the remaining \\(n-2\\) tosses can be any sequence of length \\(n-2\\) with no two consecutive heads, which is \\(a_{n-2}\\).\n\nThus, the recurrence relation is:\n\\[ a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Initial Conditions\nFor \\(n=1\\), the sequences are H and T. Only T is favorable, so \\(a_1 = 2\\).\n\nFor \\(n=2\\), the sequences are HH, HT, TH, TT. The favorable ones are HT, TH, TT, so \\(a_2 = 3\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\(p_n\\)\nThe total number of sequences of length \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). Therefore, the probability \\(p_n\\) is:\n\\[ p_n = \\frac{a_n}{2^n} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Sum\nWe need to find:\n\\[ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_n}{2^{2n}} \\]\n\nUsing the recurrence relation, we can express the generating function \\(A(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n x^n\\) as:\n\\[ A(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x-x^2} \\]\n\nWe need to evaluate:\n\\[ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_n}{4^n} = A\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) - a_0 \\]\n\nSince \\(a_0 = 1\\), we have:\n\\[ A\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{4}-\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{16}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{11}{16}} = \\frac{16}{11} \\]\n\nThus, the sum is:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{11} - 1 = \\frac{16}{11} - \\frac{11}{11} = \\frac{5}{11} \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of the sum is:\n\n\"Answer: \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\)\""
