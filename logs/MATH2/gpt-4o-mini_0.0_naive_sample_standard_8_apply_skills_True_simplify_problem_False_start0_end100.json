This means that a chosen patch can potentially block up to 8 surrounding patches (if it is not on the edge of the garden).\n   - However, since we are dealing with a grid, we need to consider the edges and corners separately.\n\n5. **Total arrangements without restrictions:**\n   - The total number of ways to choose 2 patches from 63 is given by \\( \\binom{63}{2} = \\frac{63 \\times 62}{2} = 1953 \\).\n\n6. **Counting the restricted arrangements:**\n   - For each patch chosen for roses, we need to count how many patches are blocked for mint. \n   - The number of blocked patches depends on the position of the chosen patch (corner, edge, or center). \n   - For simplicity, we can estimate that on average, each patch blocks about 4 adjacent patches (considering the average case).\n\n7. **Calculating valid arrangements:**\n   - If we assume that each patch blocks about 4 patches, then for each of the 63 patches, there are approximately \\( 63 - 5 = 58 \\) valid choices left for mint (since 1 is the chosen patch and about 4 are blocked).\n   - Thus, the total number of valid arrangements is approximately \\( 63 \\times 58 \\).\n\n8. **Final calculation:**\n   - However, since we are counting each arrangement twice (once for each order of planting), we need to divide by 2.\n   - Therefore, the total number of valid arrangements is \\( \\frac{63 \\times 58}{2} = 1827 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1827",

This means that a chosen patch can potentially block up to 8 surrounding patches (if it is not on the edge of the garden).\n   - However, since we are dealing with a grid, we need to consider the edges and corners separately.\n\n5. **Total arrangements without restrictions:**\n   - The total number of ways to choose 2 patches from 63 is given by \\( \\binom{63}{2} = \\frac{63 \\times 62}{2} = 1953 \\).\n\n6. **Counting the restricted arrangements:**\n   - For each patch chosen for roses, we need to count how many patches are blocked for mint. \n   - The number of blocked patches depends on the position of the chosen patch (corner, edge, or center). \n   - For simplicity, we can estimate that on average, each patch blocks about 4 adjacent patches (considering the average case).\n\n7. **Calculating valid arrangements:**\n   - If we assume that each patch blocks about 4 patches, then for each of the 63 patches, there are approximately \\( 63 - 5 = 58 \\) valid choices left for mint (since 1 is the chosen patch and about 4 are blocked).\n   - Thus, the total number of valid arrangements is approximately \\( 63 \\times 58 \\).\n\n8. **Final calculation:**\n   - However, since we are counting each arrangement twice (once for each order of planting), we need to divide by 2.\n   - Therefore, the total number of valid arrangements is \\( \\frac{63 \\times 58}{2} = 1827 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1827",

            "To solve the problem, we first need to determine the initial volume of water in the tank and then find out how much water is pumped in each minute.\n\n1. **Calculate the initial volume of water in the tank:**\n   The volume \\( V \\) of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.

            "To solve the problem, we first need to determine the initial volume of water in the tank and then find out how much water is pumped in each minute.\n\n1. **Calculate the initial volume of water in the tank:**\n   The volume \\( V \\) of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.

            "To solve the problem, we first need to determine the initial volume of water in the tank and then find out how much water is pumped in each minute.\n\n1. **Calculate the initial volume of water in the tank:**\n   The volume \\( V \\) of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height. Here, the radius \\( r = 3 \\) feet and the height \\( h = 4 \\) feet.\n\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi (3^2)(4) = \\pi (9)(4) = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the target volume:**\n   We want to double the initial volume of water:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Target Volume} = 2 \\times 36\\pi = 72\\pi \\text{ cubic feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Analyze the water being pumped in:**\n   The amounts of water pumped in each minute form a geometric series where:\n   -

r^n}{1 - r}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   S_n = 9 \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n}{1 - \\frac{2}{3}} = 9 \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 27 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n\\right)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Set up the equation to find \\( n \\):**\n   We want the total volume of water in the tank to equal the target volume:\n   \\[\n   36\\pi + S_n = 72\\pi\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   S_n = 72\\pi - 36\\pi = 36\\pi\n   \\]\n   Substituting for \\( S_n \\):\n   \\[\n   27 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n\\right) = 36\\pi\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( n \\):**\n   Dividing both sides by 27:\n   \\[\n   1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n = \\frac{36\\pi}{27} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n = 1 - \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( \\frac{4\\pi}{3} > 1 \\) is not possible, we need to check the calculations. \n\n   Instead, we can set:\n   \\[\n   1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n = \\frac{36\\pi}{27} \\implies \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n = 1 - \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\n   \\]\n   This indicates that we need to find \\( n \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\n   \\]\n   This is incorrect as \\( \\frac{4\\pi}{3} > 1 \\).\n\n   We need to find \\( n \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   27 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n\\right) = 36\\pi\n   \\]\n   This leads to:\n   \\[\n   1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n = \\frac{36\\pi}{27} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\n   \\]\n   This is incorrect.\n\n   We need to find \\( n \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   27 \\left(1 -

The general form for the solutions is given by:\n\n\\[\nz = 2^{5/32} e^{i \\frac{2k\\pi}{32}} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 31\n\\]\n\nThis means we have 32 distinct solutions, which can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nz_k = 2^{5/32} e^{i \\frac{k\\pi}{16}} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 31\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of all distinct solutions \\( z_k \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\sum_{k=0}^{31} z_k = \\sum_{k=0}^{31} 2^{5/32} e^{i \\frac{k\\pi}{16}}\n\\]\n\nFactoring out the constant \\( 2^{5/32} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 2^{5/32} \\sum_{k=0}^{31} e^{i \\frac{k\\pi}{16}}\n\\]\n\nThe sum \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{31} e^{i \\frac{k\\pi}{16}} \\) is a geometric series with the first term \\( 1 \\) and common ratio \\( e^{i \\frac{\\pi}{16}} \\). The number of terms is 32. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:\n\n\\[\nS_n = a \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nApplying this formula:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{31} e^{i \\frac{k\\pi}{16}} = \\frac{1 - e^{i \\frac{32\\pi}{16}}}{1 - e^{i \\frac{\\pi}{16}}} = \\frac{1 - e^{2\\pi i}}{1 - e^{i \\frac{\\pi}{16}}} = \\frac{1 - 1}{1 - e^{i \\frac{\\pi}{16}}} = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of all distinct solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 2^{5/32} \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the product of all solutions \\( z_k \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Product} = \\prod_{k=0}^{31} z_k = \\prod_{k=0}^{31} \\left( 2^{5/32} e^{i \\frac{k\\pi}{16}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThis can be separated into two parts:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Product} = \\left( 2^{5/32} \\right)^{32} \\prod_{k=0}^{31} e^{i \\frac{k\\pi}{16}} = 2^{5} \\cdot e^{i \\sum_{k=0}^{31} \\frac{k\\pi}{16}}\n\\]\n\nThe sum \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{31} k = \\frac{31 \\cdot 32}{2} = 496 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Product} = 2^5 \\cdot e^{i \\frac{496\\pi}{16}} = 32 \\cdot e^{31\\pi i} = 32 \\cdot (-1) = -32\n\\]\n\nNow we need to find the real part of the ratio of the sum of all distinct solutions to the product of all solutions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Sum}}{\\text{Product}} = \\frac{0}{-32} = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the real part of the ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Real part} = 0\n\\]\n\nFinally, we present the answer in the required format:\n\nAnswer: 0"

            "To solve the problem, we first need to understand the arrangement of the rectangular flower beds around the circular garden.\n\n1. **Identify the radius of the circular garden**: The radius of the circular garden is given as \\( r = 10 \\) feet.\n\n2. **Determine the dimensions of the rectangular flower beds**: Each flower bed has dimensions \\( 5 \\) feet by \\( 20\\sqrt{3} \\) feet. The longer side of the rectangle is \\( 20\\sqrt{3} \\) feet.\n\n3. **Positioning of the flower beds**: The problem states that the middle points of the longer sides of the rectangles are tangent to the circular garden.

Therefore, for each side, we have three possible measurements:\n\n- For side 9 cm: \n  - 8 cm (1 cm too short)\n  - 9 cm (correct)\n  - 10 cm (1 cm too long)\n\n- For side 40 cm:\n  - 39 cm (1 cm too short)\n  - 40 cm (correct)\n  - 41 cm (1 cm too long)\n\n- For side 41 cm:\n  - 40 cm (1 cm too short)\n  - 41 cm (correct)\n  - 42 cm (1 cm too long)\n\n### Step 3: Count the possible combinations\nEach side has 3 options, leading to a total of:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27 \\text{ combinations}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Exclude congruent triangles\nWe need to exclude the original triangle (9 cm, 40 cm, 41 cm) and any other combinations that are congruent to it. \n\nTo find the distinct triangles, we will check each combination of the sides and see if they satisfy the triangle inequality. We will also check for congruence.\n\n1. **Original triangle**: (9, 40, 41) - excluded.\n2. **Congruent triangles**: Any permutation of (9, 40, 41) is congruent to the original triangle.\n\nNow, we will list the possible combinations and check for congruence:\n\n- (8, 39, 40)\n- (8, 39, 41)\n- (8, 40, 41)\n- (8, 40, 42)\n- (8, 41, 42)\n- (9, 39, 40)\n- (9, 39, 41)\n- (9, 40, 42)\n- (10, 39, 40)\n- (10, 39, 41)\n- (10, 40, 41)\n- (10, 40, 42)\n- (10, 41, 42)\n\nWe will check each combination to see if they can form a triangle:\n\n- (8, 39, 40): Valid\n- (8, 39, 41): Valid\n- (8, 40, 41): Valid\n- (8, 40, 42): Valid\n- (8, 41, 42): Valid\n- (9, 39, 40): Valid\n- (9, 39, 41): Valid\n- (9, 40, 42): Valid\n- (10, 39, 40): Valid\n- (10, 39, 41): Valid\n- (10, 40, 41): Valid\n- (10, 40, 42): Valid\n- (10, 41, 42): Valid\n\nAfter checking, we find that all combinations listed above can form distinct triangles. \n\n### Conclusion\nThe total number of distinct triangles that can be formed, excluding the original triangle and any congruent triangles, is:\n\n\\[\n27 - 1 = 26\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 26"

The coordinates of point \\( P \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P} = \\frac{A_1 \\mathbf{A} + A_2 \\mathbf{B} + A_3 \\mathbf{C}}{A_1 + A_2 + A_3}.\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s assign coordinates to the vertices of triangle \\( ABC \\):\n- \\( \\mathbf{A} = (0, 0) \\)\n- \\( \\mathbf{B} = (12, 0) \\)\n- \\( \\mathbf{C} = (6, 6\\sqrt{3}) \\)\n\nNow we can calculate \\( \\mathbf{P} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3} \\cdot (0, 0) + 12\\sqrt{3} \\cdot (12, 0) + 15\\sqrt{3} \\cdot (6, 6\\sqrt{3})}{9\\sqrt{3} + 12\\sqrt{3} + 15\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{0 + 144\\sqrt{3} + (90\\sqrt{3}, 90\\cdot 6\\sqrt{3})}{36\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(144\\sqrt{3} + 90\\sqrt{3}, 540\\sqrt{3})}{36\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(234\\sqrt{3}, 540\\sqrt{3})}{36\\sqrt{3}} = \\left(\\frac{234}{36}, \\frac{540}{36}\\right) = (6.5, 15).\n\\]\n\nNow we need to calculate \\( \\mathbf{AP} + \\mathbf{BP} + \\mathbf{CP} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{AP} = \\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{A} = (6.5, 15) - (0, 0) = (6.5, 15),\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{BP} = \\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{B} = (6.5, 15) - (12, 0) = (-5.5, 15),\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{CP} = \\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{C} = (6.5, 15) - (6, 6\\sqrt{3}) = (0.5, 15 - 6\\sqrt{3}).\n\\]\n\nNow we sum these vectors:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{AP} + \\mathbf{BP} + \\mathbf{CP} = (6.5, 15) + (-5.5, 15) + (0.5, 15 - 6\\sqrt{3}).\n\\]\n\nCalculating the components:\n\n- For the x-component: \\( 6.5 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 1.5 \\).\n- For the y-component: \\( 15 + 15 + (15 - 6\\sqrt{3}) = 45 - 6\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{AP} + \\mathbf{BP} + \\mathbf{CP} = (1.5, 45 - 6\\sqrt{3}).\n\\]\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(1.5)^2 + (45 - 6\\sqrt{3})^2}.\n\\]\n\nHowever, the problem specifically asks for the vector sum, not its magnitude. Therefore, we conclude:\n\nAnswer: \\( (1.5, 45 - 6\\sqrt{3}) \\)."

Since the area of the field is 722 square meters, the maximum number of tiles that can fit is equal to the area:\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum number of tiles} = 722\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nAnswer: 722"

The remaining \\( n-2 \\) tosses can then be any valid sequence of \\( n-2 \\) tosses, which has a probability of \\( p_{n-2} \\).\n\nThus, we can write the recurrence relation:\n\\[\np_n = p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}\n\\]\nwith base cases:\n- \\( p_1 = 2 \\) (sequences: H, T)\n- \\( p_2 = 3 \\) (sequences: HT, TH, TT)\n\nNow we can compute \\( p_n \\) for the first few values:\n- \\( p_3 = p_2 + p_1 = 3 + 2 = 5 \\)\n- \\( p_4 = p_3 + p_2 = 5 + 3 = 8 \\)\n- \\( p_5 = p_4 + p_3 = 8 + 5 = 13 \\)\n\nWe can observe that the sequence \\( p_n \\) resembles the Fibonacci sequence, but shifted. Specifically, we can relate it to Fibonacci numbers \\( F_n \\) where \\( F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, F_4 = 3, \\ldots \\). The relationship is:\n\\[\np_n = F_{n+2}\n\\]\nwhere \\( F_n \\) is the \\( n \\)-th Fibonacci number.\n\nNext, we need to find the sum:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+2}}{2^n}\n\\]\n\nWe can shift the index of the sum:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+2}}{2^n} = \\sum_{m=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_m}{2^{m-2}} = 4 \\sum_{m=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_m}{2^m}\n\\]\n\nNow we need to compute \\( \\sum_{m=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_m}{2^m} \\). We can use the generating function for Fibonacci numbers:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} F_n x^n = \\frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}\n\\]\nTo find \\( \\sum_{m=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_m}{2^m} \\), we can compute:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} F_n \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 2\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to subtract the first three terms:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{2} \\frac{F_m}{2^m} = F_0 + \\frac{F_1}{2} + \\frac{F_2}{4} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_m}{2^m} = 2 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we can substitute back:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: 5}\n\\]"
