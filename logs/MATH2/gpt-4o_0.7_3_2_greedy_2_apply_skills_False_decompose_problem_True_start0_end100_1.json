According to the problem:\n- The length of the flower bed is 5 feet longer than its width: \\( L = W + 5 \\).\n- The side length of the square vegetable patch is equal to the width of the flower bed: \\( W \\).\n\n**Step 2: Use the Perimeter to Find Dimensions**\n\nThe total perimeter of the garden is 70 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:\n\\[ P = 2L + 2W = 70 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( L = W + 5 \\) into the perimeter equation:\n\\[ 2(W + 5) + 2W = 70 \\]\n\\[ 2W + 10 + 2W = 70 \\]\n\\[ 4W + 10 = 70 \\]\n\\[ 4W = 60 \\]\n\\[ W = 15 \\]\n\nNow, find \\( L \\):\n\\[ L = W + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Areas**\n\n- **Area of the Flower Bed**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of Flower Bed} = L \\times W = 20 \\times 15 = 300 \\text{ square feet}\n  \\]\n\n- **Area of the Vegetable Patch**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of Vegetable Patch} = W \\times W = 15 \\times 15 = 225 \\text{ square feet}\n  \\]\n\n- **Total Area of the Garden**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Area} = \\text{Area of Flower Bed} + \\text{Area of Vegetable Patch} = 300 + 225 = 525 \\text{ square feet}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Probability**\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen plant is in the vegetable patch is the ratio of the area of the vegetable patch to the total area of the garden:\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Area of Vegetable Patch}}{\\text{Total Area}} = \\frac{225}{525} = \\frac{15}{35} = \\frac{3}{7}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen plant is located in the vegetable patch is \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\)"

Since the perimeter of the bracelet is the total length of the sequence, we need to find sequences that have a length of exactly 6 units (since each bead is 0.5 units long, this means a sequence of 12 beads).\n\nTo do this, we should:\n\n1.

Since the perimeter must also be an integer, the only possible integer perimeter for this situation is 6 units. Therefore, we need to explore sequences that could form a ring.\n\n### Current Step:\nIdentify the sections and possible transitions between sections that can form a sequence of 6 beads, considering the series structure we have already documented.\n\n### Possible Next Step:\n1. **Within a Single Section**: Check if any single section can contain a complete sequence of 6 beads.\n   - Green sections starting with 8 beads, or larger sections, can contain a full sequence of 6 beads.

As the bracelet is cyclic, sequences that are rotations of each other are considered the same.\n\n### Count Distinct Sequences\nAfter verifying the distinctness of the sequences considering cyclic permutations, we will count how many unique bracelet configurations can be formed.\n\n### Conclusion\nOnce all sequences are verified for distinctness, we will sum the number of distinct configurations from each starting point to arrive at the total number of different bracelets possible.\n\nAnswer: The total number of distinct bracelets that can be made is **3**.",

Given that each bead is 0.5 units, this constraint is automatically satisfied for any sequence of 6 beads.\n\n2. **Apply Symmetry Considerations:**\n   We will apply Burnside's Lemma to calculate the number of distinct bracelets considering rotational and reflection symmetries.\n\n   - **Fixed by 0 rotations:** All sequences are unchanged.\n   - **Fixed by 1 rotation:** Sequences where all beads are the same color.

Since the solution to the simplified problem used Burnside's Lemma for rotational symmetry, we can similarly use this approach for the original problem.\n\nTherefore, the next concrete step is to employ Burnside's Lemma for the sequences formed from powers of 2 sections, ensuring the perimeter condition is satisfied.

In each row, there are 8 possible side-adjacent pairs (each patch can be adjacent to the next one).\n  - Total horizontal side-adjacent pairs = \\(9 \\times 8 = 72\\).\n- Consider each column of 7 patches.

However, most of these have already been counted in our previous adjacency calculation. Therefore, we will focus on additional diagonal pairings that may not have been covered:\n  - The number of additional corner-adjacent pairings, considering overcounting prevention, usually requires careful grid-specific analysis. However, assume a simplified approach where only edge and corner impacts are considered (e.g., sub-grid overlapping).\n\n### Step 3: Subtract Adjacent Pairings\nAdd the adjacent pairings calculated and subtract them from the total possible pairings:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total side-adjacent pairings} = 72 + 42 = 114\n\\]\n\nConsidering simplifications based on the example, the primary need is to compute the direct adjacency calculations and adjust for any overcounting or unique grid configurations.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Valid Pairings\nSubtract the total adjacent pairings from the total possible pairings calculated earlier:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Valid pairings} = 1953 - 114 = 1839\n\\]\n\nThis results in the number of ways to plant roses and mint patches such that they do not touch each other either by side or by corner.\n\nAnswer: 1839",

To verify the solution, let's check the steps leading to this answer:\n\n1. **Garden Configuration**:\n   - The garden is 63 feet by 49 feet, and each patch is 7 feet by 7 feet.\n   - This means the garden can be divided into a grid of \\(\\frac{63}{7} \\times \\frac{49}{7} = 9 \\times 7\\) square patches.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Patches**:\n   - There are a total of 63 patches in the grid.\n\n3. **Choosing Two Non-Touching Patches**:\n   - The task is to choose two patches such that they do not touch each other.\n\n4. **Total Ways to Choose Two Patches**:\n   - Calculate the total number of ways to choose two patches from 63:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{63}{2} = \\frac{63 \\times 62}{2} = 1953\n     \\]\n\n5. **Subtract Touching Configurations**:\n   - Calculate the number of touching configurations similar to the example solution:\n     - Horizontally adjacent: \\(8 \\times 7 = 56\\)\n     - Vertically adjacent: \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\)\n     - Diagonally adjacent (both directions): \\(48 + 48 = 96\\)\n     - Total touching pairs: \\(56 + 54 + 96 = 206\\)\n\n6. **Calculate Non-Touching Configurations**:\n   - Subtract touching configurations from total configurations:\n     \\[\n     1953 - 206 = 1747\n     \\]\n\n7. **Reconcile with Current Step**:\n   - If you calculated 1716, there might have been an oversight in counting touching configurations or in the subtraction step. Double-checking the arithmetic and logical steps should lead to the corrected count of non-touching configurations.\n\nThus, it appears there is a discrepancy in the final number.

The midpoint of the longer side (20 feet, \\(10\\sqrt{3}\\) feet) is tangent to the circle of radius 10 feet.

The possible gaps we can consider are between the silver medals and at the ends of the sequence.\n\nWe have 7 silver medals, which create 8 gaps (before the first silver, between each pair of silver medals, and after the last silver).

This step will help eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator, allowing us to express the fraction in the standard form \\(a + bi\\).\n\nLet's proceed with this step:\n\nMultiply the numerator and the denominator by \\(-3 + 4i\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{((-2+5i)(3-4i))(-3+4i)}{(-3-4i)(-3+4i)}\n\\]\n\nThe denominator simplifies as follows:\n\n\\[\n(-3-4i)(-3+4i) = (-3)^2 + (4i)^2 = 9 + 16 = 25\n\\]\n\nNow, simplify the numerator:\n\nFirst, calculate \\((-2+5i)(3-4i)\\) as before:\n\n\\[\n(-2+5i)(3-4i) = 14 + 23i\n\\]\n\nThen multiply this result by \\((-3+4i)\\):\n\n\\[\n(14+23i)(-3+4i) = 14 \\cdot (-3) + 14 \\cdot 4i + 23i \\cdot (-3) + 23i \\cdot 4i\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\(14 \\cdot (-3) = -42\\)\n- \\(14 \\cdot 4i = 56i\\)\n- \\(23i \\cdot (-3) = -69i\\)\n- \\(23i \\cdot 4i = 92i^2 = -92\\)\n\nCombine the results:\n\n\\[\n-42 + 56i - 69i - 92 = (-42 - 92) + (56i - 69i) = -134 - 13i\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-134 - 13i}{25}\n\\]\n\nFinally, express this in the form \\(a + bi\\):\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-134}{25} + \\frac{-13i}{25}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5.36 - 0.52i\n\\]\n\nAnswer: \\(-5.36 - 0.52i\\)"
