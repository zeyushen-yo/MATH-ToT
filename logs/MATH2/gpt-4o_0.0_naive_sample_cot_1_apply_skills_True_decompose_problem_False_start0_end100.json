However, for divisibility by 9, we need to ensure that at least one of these factors contributes an additional factor of 3.\n\n- If \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\), then \\( k^3 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\).\n- If \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\), then \\( k^3 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\).\n- If \\( k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), then \\( k^3 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\).\n\nThus, \\( k^3 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\) if \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Divisibility by 10\nFor \\( k^3 - k \\) to be divisible by 10, it must be divisible by both 2 and 5. Since \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\) is a product of three consecutive integers, it is always divisible by 2. For divisibility by 5, one of these integers must be divisible by 5.\n\n### Step 3: Combine Conditions\nWe need \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) and one of \\( k, k-1, k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\n### Step 4: Check Smallest Values of \\( k \\)\nLet's check small values of \\( k \\) that satisfy these conditions and also check if the sum of the digits of \\( k \\) is a prime number.\n\n- \\( k = 15 \\): \n  - \\( 15 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) and \\( 15 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\).\n  - Sum of digits of 15 is \\( 1 + 5 = 6 \\), which is not prime.\n\n- \\( k = 30 \\):\n  - \\( 30 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) and \\( 30 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\).\n  - Sum of digits of 30 is \\( 3 + 0 = 3 \\), which is prime.\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) that satisfies all the conditions is \\( k = 30 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: 30}\n\\]"

            "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many different bracelets can be made from a sequence of 6 beads such that the total length of the bracelet is an integer. Each bead has a length of 0.5 units, so the total length of the bracelet will be \\(6 \\times 0.5 = 3\\) units. Since 3 is already an integer, we don't need to worry about the length being an integer; instead, we need to focus on the arrangement of the beads.\n\nThe beads are arranged in an infinite series with a repeating pattern of red, blue, and green, and the number of beads in each section follows powers of 2. Let's break down the sequence:\n\n1. Red section: 2 beads\n2. Blue section: 4 beads\n3. Green section: 8 beads\n4. Red section: 16 beads\n5. Blue section: 32 beads\n6. Green section: 64 beads\n7. And so on...\n\nThe pattern of colors is Red, Blue, Green, and it repeats. The number of beads in each section doubles each time the color reappears.\n\nTo find the number of different bracelets, we need to consider the possible sequences of 6 beads that can be selected from this infinite series. Since the sequence is infinite and the pattern repeats, we can start at any point in the sequence and select 6 consecutive beads.\n\nLet's consider the possible starting points for a sequence of 6 beads:\n\n- Starting in a Red section:\n  - If we start in the first Red section (2 beads), we can take 2 Red beads and then move to the Blue section for the remaining 4 beads.\n  - If we start in the second Red section (16 beads), we can take any number of Red beads from 1 to 6, and then take the remaining beads from the Blue section.\n\n- Starting in a Blue section:\n  - If we start in the first Blue section (4 beads), we can take 4 Blue beads and then move to the Green section for the remaining 2 beads.\n  - If we start in the second Blue section (32 beads), we can take any number of Blue beads from 1 to 6, and then take the remaining beads from the Green section.\n\n- Starting in a Green section:\n  - If we start in the first Green section (8 beads), we can take 6 Green beads.\n  - If we start in the second Green section (64 beads), we can take any number of Green beads from 1 to 6.\n\nNow, let's count the number of different bracelets:\n\n1. Starting in the first Red section:\n   - 2 Red, 4 Blue: 1 way\n\n2. Starting in the second Red section:\n   - 1 Red, 5 Blue: 1 way\n   - 2 Red, 4 Blue: 1 way\n   - 3 Red, 3 Blue: 1 way\n   - 4 Red, 2 Blue: 1 way\n   - 5 Red, 1 Blue: 1 way\n   - 6 Red: 1 way\n\n3. Starting in the first Blue section:\n   - 4 Blue, 2 Green: 1 way\n\n4. Starting in the second Blue section:\n   - 1 Blue, 5 Green: 1 way\n   - 2 Blue, 4 Green: 1 way\n   - 3 Blue, 3 Green: 1 way\n   - 4 Blue, 2 Green: 1 way\n   - 5 Blue, 1 Green: 1 way\n   - 6 Blue: 1 way\n\n5. Starting in the first Green section:\n   - 6 Green: 1 way\n\n6. Starting in the second Green section:\n   - 1 Green, 5 Red: 1 way\n   - 2 Green, 4 Red: 1 way\n   - 3 Green, 3 Red: 1 way\n   - 4 Green, 2 Red: 1 way\n   - 5 Green, 1 Red: 1 way\n   - 6 Green: 1 way\n\nAdding up all the possible ways, we get:\n\n1 (first Red) + 6 (second Red) + 1 (first Blue) + 6 (second Blue) + 1 (first Green) + 6 (second Green) = 21 ways\n\nTherefore, the number of different bracelets that can be made is 21.\n\nAnswer: 21"

            "To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the water volume in the container over time. The process described is a geometric series where the amount of water added each minute is half of the current amount.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Amount**: The container starts with 500 mL of water.\n\n2. **Water Added Each Minute**: At each minute, the scientist adds water equal to half of the current amount. This means:\n   - After 1 minute, the amount added is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 500 = 250 \\) mL.\n   - After 2 minutes, the amount added is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times (500 + 250) = 375 \\) mL.\n   - After 3 minutes, the amount added is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times (500 + 250 + 375) = 437.5 \\) mL.\n   - And so on.\n\n3. **Total Amount of Water**: The total amount of water in the container after each minute forms a geometric series:\n   - After 0 minutes: 500 mL\n   - After 1 minute: \\( 500 + 250 = 750 \\) mL\n   - After 2 minutes: \\( 750 + 375 = 1125 \\) mL\n   - After 3 minutes: \\( 1125 + 437.5 = 1562.5 \\) mL\n   - And so on.\n\n4. **General Formula**: The total amount of water after \\( n \\) minutes is given by the sum of a geometric series:\n   \\[\n   S_n = 500 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\cdots + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\\right)\n   \\]\n   This is a geometric series with the first term \\( a = 500 \\) and common ratio \\( r = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n5. **Sum of the Series**: The sum of the first \\( n+1 \\) terms of a geometric series is:\n   \\[\n   S_n = 500 \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n+1}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 1000 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n+1}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Convergence**: As \\( n \\) approaches infinity, the series converges to 1000 mL (or 1 liter).\n\n7. **Finding \\( n \\)**: We need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the total amount of water in liters is never in the interval \\([n, n+1]\\). Since the series converges to 1 liter, we need to find \\( n \\) such that the total amount of water is never between \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\) liters.\n\n   - Convert mL to liters: \\( 1000 \\) mL = \\( 1 \\) liter.\n   - The series converges to 1 liter, so the total amount of water will never exceed 1 liter.\n   - Therefore, the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the amount of water is never in the interval \\([n, n+1]\\) is \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1"

Total = 9 * 8 = 72 pairs.\n   - **Vertical touching pairs:** There are 7 columns, each with 8 possible vertical touching pairs (since there are 9 patches per column). Total = 7 * 8 = 56 pairs.\n   - **Diagonal touching pairs:** For diagonal touching, consider both diagonals (top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left).\n     - Top-left to bottom-right diagonal: There are 8 diagonals with 8 touching pairs each (4 diagonals in each direction).

            "To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions given and how they relate to the geometry of the circle in the complex plane.\n\n1. **Understanding the Circle**: The circle is centered at the origin with a radius of 9. Therefore, any point \\( z = a + bi \\) on this circle satisfies the equation:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 = 9^2 = 81\n   \\]\n\n2. **Condition on the Product**: We are asked to find the probability that the product of the modulus of \\( z \\) and its imaginary part is at least 40.5. The modulus of \\( z \\) is the radius of the circle, which is 9. Therefore, the condition becomes:\n   \\[\n   9 \\cdot |b| \\geq 40.5\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this inequality gives:\n   \\[\n   |b| \\geq \\frac{40.5}{9} = 4.5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Geometric Interpretation**: The condition \\( |b| \\geq 4.5 \\) means that the imaginary part \\( b \\) of the point \\( z \\) must be either greater than or equal to 4.5 or less than or equal to -4.5. \n\n4. **Finding the Relevant Arc**: The circle is symmetric about the real axis. The line \\( b = 4.5 \\) intersects the circle at two points, and similarly, the line \\( b = -4.5 \\) intersects the circle at two points. We need to find the arc length of the circle where \\( |b| \\geq 4.5 \\).\n\n5. **Calculating Intersection Points**: For \\( b = 4.5 \\), substitute into the circle equation:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + (4.5)^2 = 81 \\implies a^2 + 20.25 = 81 \\implies a^2 = 60.75 \\implies a = \\pm \\sqrt{60.75}\n   \\]\n   Similarly, for \\( b = -4.5 \\), the values of \\( a \\) are the same: \\( a = \\pm \\sqrt{60.75} \\).\n\n6. **Arc Length Calculation**: The points of intersection divide the circle into four arcs. We are interested in the two arcs where \\( |b| \\geq 4.5 \\). The angle \\( \\theta \\) corresponding to \\( b = 4.5 \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sin \\theta = \\frac{4.5}{9} = 0.5 \\implies \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the arc from \\( b = 4.5 \\) to \\( b = -4.5 \\) spans an angle of \\( \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\).\n\n7. **Probability Calculation**: The total angle for which \\( |b| \\geq 4.5 \\) is \\( 2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\). The total circumference of the circle is \\( 2\\pi \\). Thus, the probability is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{4\\pi}{3}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the modulus and the imaginary part is at least 40.5 is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]"

We will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the remainder modulo 105 by considering the problem modulo 3, 5, and 7 separately.\n\n### Step 1: Modulo 3\nFor any \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\((4n)!\\) contains the factor 3, because \\(4n \\geq 8\\) and 8! includes the factor 3. Therefore, for \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\((4n)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\nFor \\(n = 1\\), \\((4 \\times 1)! = 4! = 24\\), and \\(24 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\nThus, \\((4n)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\) for all \\(n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 49\\).\n\n### Step 2: Modulo 5\nFor any \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\((4n)!\\) contains the factor 5, because \\(4n \\geq 8\\) and 8! includes the factor 5.

The volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi \\times 3^2 \\times 4 = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Total Volume Needed to Double:**\n\n   To double the initial volume, the total volume needed is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 36\\pi = 72\\pi \\text{ cubic feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Additional Volume Required:**\n\n   The additional volume of water needed to double the initial volume is:\n   \\[\n   72\\pi - 36\\pi = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Understand the Geometric Series:**\n\n   The amount of water pumped each minute forms a geometric series with:\n   - First term \\( r_1 = 9 \\)\n   - Second term \\( r_2 = 6 \\)\n\n   The common ratio \\( r \\) of the series can be found by:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{r_2}{r_1} = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Sum of the Geometric Series:**\n\n   The sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series with first term \\( a \\) and common ratio \\( r \\) (where \\( |r| < 1 \\)) is given by:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n   \\]\n\n   For our series:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{9}{1 - \\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{9}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 27 \\text{ cubic feet}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the Number of Minutes:**\n\n   We need to find how many full minutes it takes to pump at least \\( 36\\pi \\) cubic feet of water. Since the infinite series only sums to 27 cubic feet, we need to find the sum of the series up to a certain number of terms that will reach or exceed \\( 36\\pi \\).\n\n   The sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric series is:\n   \\[\n   S_n = a \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\n   \\]\n\n   We need to solve for \\( n \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   9 \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n}{1 - \\frac{2}{3}} \\geq 36\\pi - 36\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   27(1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n) \\geq 36\\pi - 36\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for \\( n \\) requires numerical or iterative methods, but since the infinite series only sums to 27, and we need more than 27 cubic feet, the series alone cannot double the volume. Therefore, the series cannot achieve the required volume, and the problem as stated has no solution within the constraints given.\n\n   However, if we assume a mistake in the problem setup and consider the series can somehow reach the required volume, we would need to calculate the exact number of terms needed to reach or exceed \\( 36\\pi \\).\n\n   Since the problem setup is inconsistent with the series sum, the answer is based on the assumption that the series alone cannot double the volume.\n\n**Answer: No solution within the given constraints.**"

            "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that a randomly selected student correctly answered at least one question of each type: multiple-choice, true or false, and numerical-answer questions. We will use the information that each type of question was answered correctly by 60% of the students on average.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the probability of answering each type of question correctly:**\n   - For multiple-choice questions, the probability of answering one question correctly is 0.6.\n   - For true or false questions, the probability of answering one question correctly is 0.6.\n   - For numerical-answer questions, the probability of answering one question correctly is 0.6.\n\n2. **Calculate the probability of not answering any question correctly for each type:**\n   - For multiple-choice questions, the probability of not answering any of the 5 questions correctly is the probability of answering each question incorrectly raised to the power of 5. The probability of answering a question incorrectly is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. Therefore, the probability of not answering any multiple-choice question correctly is \\(0.4^5\\).\n   - For true or false questions, similarly, the probability of not answering any of the 5 questions correctly is \\(0.4^5\\).\n   - For numerical-answer questions, the probability of not answering any of the 5 questions correctly is \\(0.4^5\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of not answering at least one question correctly for each type:**\n   - The probability of not answering at least one multiple-choice question correctly is 1 - \\(0.4^5\\).\n   - The probability of not answering at least one true or false question correctly is 1 - \\(0.4^5\\).\n   - The probability of not answering at least one numerical-answer question correctly is 1 - \\(0.4^5\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the probability of answering at least one question correctly for each type:**\n   - Since the events are independent, the probability of answering at least one question correctly for each type is the product of the probabilities calculated in step 3.\n\n5. **Calculate the final probability:**\n   - The probability that a student correctly answered at least one question of each type is:\n     \\[\n     (1 - 0.4^5) \\times (1 - 0.4^5) \\times (1 - 0.4^5)\n     \\]\n\n6. **Compute the numerical value:**\n   - First, calculate \\(0.4^5\\):\n     \\[\n     0.4^5 = 0.01024\n     \\]\n   - Then, calculate \\(1 - 0.01024 = 0.98976\\).\n   - Finally, compute the product:\n     \\[\n     0.98976 \\times 0.98976 \\times 0.98976 \\approx 0.969\n     \\]\n\n7. **Round the probability to the nearest whole number:**\n   - The probability rounded to the nearest whole number is 97%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected student correctly answered at least one of each type of question is approximately 97%.\n\nAnswer: 97"

            "To solve the problem, we need to find three-digit positive integers that satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. The integer is divisible by 5.\n2. When divided by 4, the remainder is 3.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the conditions\n\n- **Divisibility by 5**: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5.\n- **Remainder of 3 when divided by 4**: This means the number can be expressed in the form \\( n = 4k + 3 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 2: Combine the conditions\n\nWe need numbers that satisfy both conditions. Let's consider the possible last digits:\n\n- If the last digit is 0, the number is of the form \\( 10a + 0 \\). For this number to give a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, we have:\n  \\[\n  10a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\n  \\]\n  Simplifying, \\( 10 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} \\), so:\n  \\[\n  2a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\n  \\]\n  This equation has no solution because 2 and 4 are not coprime.\n\n- If the last digit is 5, the number is of the form \\( 10a + 5 \\). For this number to give a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, we have:\n  \\[\n  10a + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\n  \\]\n  Simplifying, \\( 10 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} \\), so:\n  \\[\n  2a + 1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}\n  \\]\n  Dividing through by 2, we get:\n  \\[\n  a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}\n  \\]\n  This means \\( a \\) is odd.\n\n### Step 3: Find the range of numbers\n\nSince we are looking for three-digit numbers, \\( n = 10a + 5 \\) must satisfy \\( 100 \\leq n \\leq 999 \\).\n\n- The smallest three-digit number is 100. For \\( n = 10a + 5 \\), the smallest \\( a \\) is:\n  \\[\n  10a + 5 \\geq 100 \\implies 10a \\geq 95 \\implies a \\geq 9.5\n  \\]\n  Since \\( a \\) is odd, the smallest odd \\( a \\) is 11.\n\n- The largest three-digit number is 999. For \\( n = 10a + 5 \\), the largest \\( a \\) is:\n  \\[\n  10a + 5 \\leq 999 \\implies 10a \\leq 994 \\implies a \\leq 99.4\n  \\]\n  The largest odd \\( a \\) is 99.\n\n### Step 4: Count the valid numbers\n\nThe odd numbers from 11 to 99 form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 11, the last term 99, and a common difference of 2.\n\nThe number of terms in this sequence is given by:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{\\text{last term} - \\text{first term}}{\\text{common difference}} + 1 = \\frac{99 - 11}{2} + 1 = 45\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 45 three-digit numbers that satisfy both conditions.\n\n**Answer: 45**"

Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Regular Price:**\n   - Each soda can costs 75 cents, which is $0.75.\n\n2. **Understand the Offer:**\n   - If you buy a certain number of cans, the store will sell you twice as many cans for 50% more money than the initial purchase.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equations:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of cans you initially decide to buy.\n   - The cost for \\( x \\) cans at the regular price is \\( 0.75x \\) dollars.\n   - Under the offer, you can get \\( 2x \\) cans for \\( 1.5 \\times 0.75x = 1.125x \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Maximize the Number of Cans:**\n   - We want to maximize the number of cans, \\( 2x \\), while keeping the total cost under $30.\n   - The condition is \\( 1.125x \\leq 30 \\).\n\n5. **Solve the Inequality:**\n   \\[\n   1.125x \\leq 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x \\leq \\frac{30}{1.125}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x \\leq 26.67\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\( x \\) must be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a can), the maximum integer value for \\( x \\) is 26.\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Number of Cans:**\n   - If \\( x = 26 \\), then under the offer, you can buy \\( 2 \\times 26 = 52 \\) cans.\n\n7. **Verify the Cost:**\n   - The cost for 26 cans at the regular price is \\( 0.75 \\times 26 = 19.5 \\) dollars.\n   - Under the offer, the cost for 52 cans is \\( 1.125 \\times 26 = 29.25 \\) dollars, which is within the $30 budget.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of soda cans you can purchase with $30 under this offer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: 52}\n\\]"

Finally, we will sum these two results.\n\n### Part 1: Greatest Prime Factor of \\(12! + 8!\\)\n\nFirst, let's calculate \\(12!\\) and \\(8!\\):\n\n- \\(12! = 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\)\n- \\(8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\)\n\nNotice that \\(12! = 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times (8!)\\). Therefore, we can factor \\(8!\\) out of \\(12! + 8!\\):\n\n\\[\n12! + 8! = 8!(12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 + 1)\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 = 11880\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n12! + 8! = 8!(11880 + 1) = 8! \\times 11881\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the greatest prime factor of \\(11881\\). We will check for divisibility by prime numbers:\n\n- \\(11881\\) is odd, not divisible by 2.\n- Sum of digits of \\(11881\\) is \\(1 + 1 + 8 + 8 + 1 = 19\\), not divisible by 3.\n- Last digit is not 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.\n- Check divisibility by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113.\n\nAfter checking, we find that \\(11881\\) is divisible by 109:\n\n\\[\n11881 \\div 109 = 109\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(11881 = 109 \\times 109\\), and the greatest prime factor is 109.\n\n### Part 2: Product of the Coefficients of the Polynomial\n\nThe polynomial is \\(f(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7\\). The coefficients are 4, -2, 5, and -7. The product of these coefficients is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times (-2) \\times 5 \\times (-7) = 4 \\times (-2) \\times 5 \\times (-7) = 4 \\times 2 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 280\n\\]\n\n### Final Step: Sum the Results\n\nNow, sum the greatest prime factor of \\(12! + 8!\\) and the product of the coefficients:\n\n\\[\n109 + 280 = 389\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: 389}\n\\]"

Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have 5 gold medals (G) and 7 silver medals (S).\n   - The medals are to be arranged in a line of 12 positions.\n   - No two gold medals can be adjacent.\n   - We need to find the expected average position of the gold medals.\n\n2. **Arranging the Silver Medals:**\n   - First, place the 7 silver medals in a line. This creates 8 gaps (including the ends) where gold medals can be placed: _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _.\n\n3. **Placing the Gold Medals:**\n   - We need to choose 5 out of these 8 gaps to place the gold medals. This ensures that no two gold medals are adjacent.\n   - The number of ways to choose 5 gaps from 8 is given by the combination formula: \\(\\binom{8}{5} = \\binom{8}{3} = 56\\).\n\n4. **Calculating the Expected Position:**\n   - Each configuration of medals corresponds to a specific set of positions for the gold medals.\n   - We need to calculate the average position of the gold medals for each configuration and then find the expected value over all configurations.\n\n5. **Position Calculation:**\n   - Consider the positions of the gaps: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n   - If a gold medal is placed in a gap, its position in the lineup is determined by the number of silver medals before it.\n   - For example, if a gold medal is placed in the first gap, its position is 1. If placed in the second gap, its position is 2 + 1 = 3, and so on.\n\n6. **Expected Position Calculation:**\n   - The expected position of a single gold medal is the average of all possible positions it can occupy.\n   - The positions for gold medals are determined by the gaps they occupy. The positions are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (odd positions).\n   - The expected position of a single gold medal is the average of these positions: \\((1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11) / 6 = 36 / 6 = 6\\).\n\n7. **Expected Average Position of All Gold Medals:**\n   - Since the expected position of each gold medal is 6, and there are 5 gold medals, the expected average position of the gold medals is also 6.\n\nTherefore, the expected location that the teacher stands at is position 6.\n\nAnswer: 6"

Each turn forms a right triangle with the vertical ascent as one leg (2 meters) and the circumference as the other leg (\\(2\\pi\\) meters).\n   - The length of one turn is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Length of one turn} = \\sqrt{(2)^2 + (2\\pi)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 4\\pi^2}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Length of the Cable:**\n   - Since there are 5 turns, the total length of the cable is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total length} = 5 \\times \\sqrt{4 + 4\\pi^2}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n   - First, calculate \\(4\\pi^2\\):\n     \\[\n     4\\pi^2 \\approx 4 \\times (3.14159)^2 \\approx 4 \\times 9.8696 \\approx 39.4784\n     \\]\n   - Then, calculate \\(4 + 4\\pi^2\\):\n     \\[\n     4 + 39.4784 = 43.4784\n     \\]\n   - The length of one turn is:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{43.4784} \\approx 6.591\n     \\]\n   - The total length of the cable is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 6.591 \\approx 32.955\n     \\]\n\n7. **Round to the Nearest Integer:**\n   - The total length of the cable, rounded to the nearest integer, is 33 meters.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the cable is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: 33}\n\\]"

However, we are only interested in the first six non-trivial factors.\n\n### Step 2: List the factors of 720\nThe factors of 720 are:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 48, 60, 72, 80, 90, 120, 144, 180, 240, 360, 720\n\n### Step 3: Identify the first six non-trivial factors\nThe first six non-trivial factors (excluding 1) are:\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the sum of these factors\nSum = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 = 28\n\n### Step 5: Use the circumference formula to find the radius\nThe circumference \\( C \\) of a circle is given by the formula:\n\\[ C = 2\\pi r \\]\n\nWe know that the circumference is equal to the sum of the factors, which is 28. Therefore:\n\\[ 2\\pi r = 28 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for the radius \\( r \\)\n\\[ r = \\frac{28}{2\\pi} \\]\n\\[ r = \\frac{14}{\\pi} \\]\n\n### Step 7: Calculate and round the radius\nUsing the approximation \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14159\\):\n\\[ r \\approx \\frac{14}{3.14159} \\]\n\\[ r \\approx 4.454 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the radius is approximately 4.\n\n### Final Answer\nAnswer: 4"

The number of such sequences is \\(a_{n-2}\\).\n\n   - Therefore, the recurrence relation is:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - For \\(n = 1\\), the sequences are: H, T. Only T is valid, so \\(a_1 = 2\\).\n   - For \\(n = 2\\), the sequences are: HH, HT, TH, TT. The valid sequences are HT, TH, TT, so \\(a_2 = 3\\).\n\n4. **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n   - The recurrence relation \\(a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\\) with initial conditions \\(a_1 = 2\\) and \\(a_2 = 3\\) is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but shifted.\n   - The solution to this recurrence is:\n     \\[\n     a_n = F_{n+2}\n     \\]\n   - where \\(F_n\\) is the Fibonacci sequence with \\(F_1 = 1\\), \\(F_2 = 1\\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\(p_n\\):**\n   - The total number of sequences of length \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\).\n   - Therefore, the probability \\(p_n\\) is:\n     \\[\n     p_n = \\frac{a_n}{2^n} = \\frac{F_{n+2}}{2^n}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Evaluate the Infinite Series:**\n   - We need to find:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+2}}{2^{2n}}\n     \\]\n   - This series can be evaluated using the generating function for the Fibonacci sequence:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} F_n x^n = \\frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\(x = \\frac{1}{4}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} F_n \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^n = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{11}{16}} = \\frac{4}{11}\n     \\]\n   - The series we need is:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+2}}{4^n} = \\frac{4}{11} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{16}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4}{11} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{64}{176} - \\frac{44}{176} - \\frac{11}{176} = \\frac{9}{176}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the value of the series is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{11}}\n\\]"
