This implies \\( k \\equiv 0, 1, 2 \\pmod{3} \\) since \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\) is a product of three consecutive integers, and one of them must be divisible by 3.\n\nNext, for \\( k^3 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10} \\), again \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10} \\) implies \\( k \\equiv 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\pmod{10} \\) specifically ensuring that the product \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\) is divisible by 2 and 5.\n\nNow check combinations of these congruences to find the smallest \\( k \\) that satisfies both conditions. This can be done by trial and error starting from the smallest \\( k \\).\n\nAfter trying combinations, we find:\n- For \\( k = 5 \\), check divisibility of \\( 5^3 - 5 = 120 \\) by 9 and 10. \\( 120 \\) is divisible by both 9 (\\( 120 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\)) is false and 10.

Sum of digits is 1 + 8 = 9 which is not a prime, so keep searching.\n\nUpon checking further values:\n\n- \\( k = 30 \\), \\( 30^3 - 30 = 27000 \\) is divisible by 90, sum of digits is 3 which is a prime.\n\nThus, the smallest \\( k \\) is 30."

                    "The elements of $S_1$ are $1, 5, 9, \\dots, 97$, and the elements of $S_2$ are $3, 7, 11, \\dots, 99$. We need to find the sum of the absolute differences between all pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \\in S_1$ and $b \\in S_2$.\n\nTo do this, let's first note the number of elements in each set:\n- The sequence for $S_1$ is $1, 5, 9, \\ldots, 97$. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term $a_1 = 1$ and common difference $d = 4$. The last term is $97$. Using the formula for the $n$-th term of an arithmetic sequence $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, we have:\n  \\[\n  97 = 1 + (n-1) \\cdot 4 \\implies 96 = (n-1) \\cdot 4 \\implies n-1 = 24 \\implies n = 25.\n  \\]\n  So, $S_1$ has 25 elements.\n\n- The sequence for $S_2$ is $3, 7, 11, \\ldots, 99$. This is also an arithmetic sequence with the first term $b_1 = 3$ and common difference $d = 4$. The last term is $99$. Using the same formula:\n  \\[\n  99 = 3 + (m-1) \\cdot 4 \\implies 96 = (m-1) \\cdot 4 \\implies m-1 = 24 \\implies m = 25.\n  \\]\n  So, $S_2$ also has 25 elements.\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the absolute differences. Each element $a_i \\in S_1$ and $b_j \\in S_2$ will form a pair, and we need to compute the sum of $|a_i - b_j|$. We can find the sum of differences directly using symmetry and properties of arithmetic sequences:\n\n1. Calculate the sum of elements in $S_1$:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of } S_1 = \\frac{25}{2} \\times (1 + 97) = 25 \\times 49 = 1225.\n   \\]\n\n2.
