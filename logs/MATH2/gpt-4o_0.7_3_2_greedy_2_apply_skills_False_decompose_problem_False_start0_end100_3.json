This implies \\( k \\equiv 0, 1, 2 \\pmod{3} \\) since \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\) is a product of three consecutive integers, and one of them must be divisible by 3.\n\nNext, for \\( k^3 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10} \\), again \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10} \\) implies \\( k \\equiv 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\pmod{10} \\) specifically ensuring that the product \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\) is divisible by 2 and 5.\n\nNow check combinations of these congruences to find the smallest \\( k \\) that satisfies both conditions. This can be done by trial and error starting from the smallest \\( k \\).\n\nAfter trying combinations, we find:\n- For \\( k = 5 \\), check divisibility of \\( 5^3 - 5 = 120 \\) by 9 and 10. \\( 120 \\) is divisible by both 9 (\\( 120 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\)) is false and 10.

Sum of digits is 1 + 8 = 9 which is not a prime, so keep searching.\n\nUpon checking further values:\n\n- \\( k = 30 \\), \\( 30^3 - 30 = 27000 \\) is divisible by 90, sum of digits is 3 which is a prime.\n\nThus, the smallest \\( k \\) is 30."

                    "The elements of $S_1$ are $1, 5, 9, \\dots, 97$, and the elements of $S_2$ are $3, 7, 11, \\dots, 99$. We need to find the sum of the absolute differences between all pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \\in S_1$ and $b \\in S_2$.\n\nTo do this, let's first note the number of elements in each set:\n- The sequence for $S_1$ is $1, 5, 9, \\ldots, 97$. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term $a_1 = 1$ and common difference $d = 4$. The last term is $97$. Using the formula for the $n$-th term of an arithmetic sequence $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, we have:\n  \\[\n  97 = 1 + (n-1) \\cdot 4 \\implies 96 = (n-1) \\cdot 4 \\implies n-1 = 24 \\implies n = 25.\n  \\]\n  So, $S_1$ has 25 elements.\n\n- The sequence for $S_2$ is $3, 7, 11, \\ldots, 99$. This is also an arithmetic sequence with the first term $b_1 = 3$ and common difference $d = 4$. The last term is $99$. Using the same formula:\n  \\[\n  99 = 3 + (m-1) \\cdot 4 \\implies 96 = (m-1) \\cdot 4 \\implies m-1 = 24 \\implies m = 25.\n  \\]\n  So, $S_2$ also has 25 elements.\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the absolute differences. Each element $a_i \\in S_1$ and $b_j \\in S_2$ will form a pair, and we need to compute the sum of $|a_i - b_j|$. We can find the sum of differences directly using symmetry and properties of arithmetic sequences:\n\n1. Calculate the sum of elements in $S_1$:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of } S_1 = \\frac{25}{2} \\times (1 + 97) = 25 \\times 49 = 1225.\n   \\]\n\n2.

                    "To determine how many diagonal-aligned tiles fit along the length and width of the field, we first calculate the effective side length of a square tile when placed at a 45-degree angle. Each side of the square tile forms a right triangle with the diagonal, and the height (or width) of this triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) meters. This is because the diagonal of a square tile with side length 1 meter is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) meters.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many such diagonal-aligned tiles fit along the length and width of the field:\n\n1. **Field dimensions:** Let the width of the field be \\( w \\) meters. Then, the length \\( l \\) of the field is \\( 2w \\) meters. Given the area of the field is 200 square meters, we have:\n   \\[\n   w \\times 2w = 200 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2w^2 = 200 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad w^2 = 100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad w = 10 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the width \\( w = 10 \\) meters and the length \\( l = 20 \\) meters.\n\n2. **Effective tile size:** The effective side length of a tile placed at 45 degrees is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) meters.\n\n3. **Number of tiles along width:** The number of tiles that can fit along the width is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 14.14\n   \\]\n   This means 14 whole tiles fit along the width.\n\n4. **Number of tiles along length:** The number of tiles that can fit along the length is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = 20 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 28.28\n   \\]\n   This means 28 whole tiles fit along the length.\n\n5. **Total number of tiles that fit:** The total number of whole tiles that can fit in the field is \\( 14 \\times 28 = 392 \\).\n\n6. **Calculate tiled area:** Since each tile covers 1 square meter, the tiled area is 392 square meters. However, this exceeds the field's area, indicating an error in counting due to the overlap when placing tiles diagonally.\n\nGiven constraints and calculations, we should instead focus on maximizing coverage without exceeding the field dimensions. Since the area cannot be fully covered due to the orientation, we calculate the minimum grassy area by subtracting the tiled area from the total area of the field:\n\n**Minimum grassy area:**\n\\[\n200 - \\left(14 \\times 14 \\right) = 200 - 196 = 4 \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum area of the grassy regions of the field is 4 square meters.\n\nAnswer: 4"

            "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many \\(45\\)-degree rotated tiles fit within the field and subsequently calculate the grassy area.\n\nFirst, let's determine the dimensions of the rectangular field. Given that the length is twice the width and the area is 200 square meters, let \\(w\\) be the width and \\(2w\\) be the length. Therefore, the equation for the area is:\n\\[ w \\times 2w = 200 \\]\n\\[ 2w^2 = 200 \\]\n\\[ w^2 = 100 \\]\n\\[ w = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the width of the field is 10 meters, and the length is 20 meters.\n\nNow, when a square tile of side 1 meter is rotated by \\(45\\) degrees, its diagonal becomes the effective measurement that determines how it fits within the field. The diagonal of such a tile is:\n\\[ \\sqrt{2} \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nNext, calculate how many such diagonals fit along the width and length of the field (without overlap or cutting):\n- Along the width of 10 meters: \n  \\[ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{1.414} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 7.07 \\right\\rfloor = 7 \\]\n- Along the length of 20 meters:\n  \\[ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{1.414} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 14.14 \\right\\rfloor = 14 \\]\n\nThus, the maximum number of \\(45\\)-degree rotated square tiles that fit within the field is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 14 = 98 \\]\n\nEach tile covers 1 square meter, so these tiles cover 98 square meters of the field.\n\nFinally, calculate the minimum area of the grassy regions by subtracting the tiled area from the total area of the field:\n\\[ 200 - 98 = 102 \\]\n\nAnswer: 102"

Since the radius of the garden is 10 feet, the distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the longer side of the rectangle (which is tangent to the circle) is 10 feet. The longer side of the rectangle is 20\u221a3 feet, so the center of the rectangle is 10\u221a3 feet away from the tangent point. Therefore, the overall distance from the center of the circle to the center of the rectangle is 20 feet (10 feet radius + 10\u221a3 feet). We can now calculate the angular span of this rectangle with respect to the center of the circle. \n\nThe angular span, \u03b8, can be calculated using the formula \u03b8 = 2 * arcsin((half-width of the rectangle) / (distance from the center of the circle to the center of the rectangle)). The half-width of the rectangle is 2.5 feet. Thus, \u03b8 = 2 * arcsin(2.5 / 20) = 2 * arcsin(0.125).\n\nCalculate \u03b8: \u03b8 = 2 * arcsin(0.125) = 2 * 0.125327 = 0.250654 radians.\n\nThis angular span can then be used to determine how many such rectangles can be placed around the full circle of 2\u03c0 radians. The number of rectangles is given by the integer part of the division of 2\u03c0 radians by the angular span \u03b8.\n\nMaximum number of rectangles = \u230a2\u03c0 / 0.250654\u230b = \u230a25.0792\u230b = 25.",

                    "Possible next step: Instead of manually checking for divisibility by each prime number, it's more efficient to use a primality test to determine if 1697 is prime. Let's use a simple primality test up to the square root of 1697, which is approximately 41.2. We have already checked divisibility by primes up to 41, so we can conclude that 1697 is a prime number. Therefore, the greatest prime factor of 12! + 8! is 1697.\n\nNow, let's calculate the product of the coefficients of the polynomial \\( f(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7 \\).

                    "It seems like the process of checking divisibility has become quite lengthy, and it is likely that 1697 may be a prime number itself. To verify this, we can quickly check if 1697 is indeed a prime number using a primality test or by confirming divisibility up to the square root of 1697.\n\nThe square root of 1697 is approximately 41.2, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 41.

We need to find the expected value for each position, and then scale it to the actual lineup positions (from 1 to 12).

For intersection, the frog can be at any point (x, y) where x + y = 5 and needs to reach this point from (0,0) and then from this point to (4,3).\n\nConsider the points on the barrier:\n- (0,5): No valid paths as the frog cannot start here.\n- (1,4): No valid paths as the frog cannot move here before reaching (4,3).\n- (2,3): The frog can reach (2, 3) from (0, 0) using C(5, 2) paths and then reach (4, 3) from (2, 3) using C(2, 2) paths.\n- (3,2): The frog can reach (3, 2) from (0, 0) using C(5, 3) paths and then reach (4, 3) from (3, 2) using C(2, 1) paths.\n- (4,1): The frog can reach (4, 1) from (0, 0) using C(5, 4) paths and then reach (4, 3) from (4, 1) using C(2, 2) paths.\n- (5,0): No valid paths as the frog cannot start here.\n\nNow let's compute these:\n\n- For (2,3): \n  - Paths to (2,3): C(5, 2) = 10\n  - Paths from (2,3) to (4,3): C(2, 2) = 1\n  - Total paths through (2,3): 10 * 1 = 10\n\n- For (3,2):\n  - Paths to (3,2): C(5, 3) = 10\n  - Paths from (3,2) to (4,3): C(2, 1) = 2\n  - Total paths through (3,2): 10 * 2 = 20\n\n- For (4,1):\n  - Paths to (4,1): C(5, 4) = 5\n  - Paths from (4,1) to (4,3): C(2, 2) = 1\n  - Total paths through (4,1): 5 * 1 = 5\n\nSum of paths that intersect the barrier = 10 + 20 + 5 = 35.\n\nNow subtract these paths from the total number of unrestricted paths:\n\n35 (total paths) - 35 (barrier-intersecting paths) = 0\n\nHowever, this means all paths intersect the barrier, which implies no valid paths exist without intersecting the barrier.\n\nAnswer: 0"

Since the baker uses 714 grams of flour, set up the proportion \\( \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{x}{714} \\) to find \\( x \\), the grams of water. Solving for \\( x \\), we get \\( x = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 714 \\). This calculation gives \\( x = 285.6 \\). Rounding to the nearest whole number, the baker should use 286 grams of water. Then, calculate the total weight of the dough, which is 714 grams of flour plus 286 grams of water, totaling 1000 grams. Next, divide the total dough weight by 45 grams per piece to estimate the number of pieces: \\( \\frac{1000}{45} \\approx 22.22 \\), so the baker can make 22 full 45-gram pieces, with a remainder for one additional piece.

Therefore, we can invite a maximum of 20 guests.\n\nAnswer: 20",

Thus, the area of the square vegetable garden is 5 feet \u00d7 5 feet = 25 square feet. The length of the fencing used, 20 feet, squared is 400. Therefore, the total area plus the square of the length of the fencing is 25 + 400 = 425 square feet."
