Each bead is 0.5 units long, so the total length of 6 beads is \\(6 \\times 0.5 = 3\\) units. For the perimeter to be an integer, 3 units must be an integer, which it already is.\n\nLet's examine how many different ways we can select 6 consecutive beads from the sequence:\n\n1. Starting from the initial red section (2 beads) and moving across sections:\n   - 0-2 Red, 0-4 Blue\n   - 0-2 Red, 1-4 Blue\n   - 0-2 Red, 2-4 Blue\n   - 0-2 Red, 3-4 Blue\n   - 0-2 Red, 4 Blue, 0 Green\n   - 1-2 Red, 0-4 Blue\n   - 1-2 Red, 1-4 Blue\n   - 1-2 Red, 2-4 Blue\n   - 1-2 Red, 3-4 Blue\n   - 1-2 Red, 4 Blue, 0 Green\n   - 2 Red, 0-4 Blue\n   - 2 Red, 1-4 Blue\n   - 2 Red, 2-4 Blue\n   - 2 Red, 3-4 Blue\n   - 2 Red, 4 Blue, 0 Green\n   - 0 Blue, 0-4 Green\n   - 1 Blue, 0-4 Green\n   - 2 Blue, 0-4 Green\n   - 3 Blue, 0-4 Green\n   - 4 Blue, 0-4 Green\n   - 0 Green, 0-2 Red\n   - 1 Green, 0-2 Red\n   - 2 Green, 0-2 Red\n   - 3 Green, 0-2 Red\n   - 4 Green, 0-2 Red\n\nContinue similarly for blue and green segments.\n\n2. Now let's calculate the possible configurations:\n   - Red: 2, Blue: 4, Green: 8\n   - Blue: 4, Red: 2, Green: 8\n   - Green: 8, Red: 2, Blue: 4\n\nThese sequences cover all possible arrangements of 6 consecutive beads. Since each bead length already satisfies the perimeter condition, all sequences are valid as each can form a bracelet.\n\nTo count the possible sequences:\n- Red can be selected from 0-2, Blue from 0-4, Green from 0-8, and so on.\n\nCounting valid sequences:\n- Starting from Red:\n  - 2 Red, 4 Blue = 1 sequence\n  - 2 Red, 3 Blue, 1 Green = 1 sequence\n  - 2 Red, 2 Blue, 2 Green = 1 sequence\n  - 2 Red, 1 Blue, 3 Green = 1 sequence\n  - 2 Red, 0 Blue, 4 Green = 1 sequence\n- Starting from Blue:\n  - 4 Blue, 2 Green = 1 sequence\n  - 3 Blue, 2 Green, 1 Red = 1 sequence\n  - 2 Blue, 2 Green, 2 Red = 1 sequence\n  - 1 Blue, 2 Green, 3 Red = 1 sequence\n  - 0 Blue, 2 Green, 4 Red = 1 sequence\n  - Continue similarly for green.\n\nAdding these, we get 10 possible unique sequences that satisfy the conditions.\n\nThus, the number of different bracelets that can be made is:\n\nAnswer: 10",
