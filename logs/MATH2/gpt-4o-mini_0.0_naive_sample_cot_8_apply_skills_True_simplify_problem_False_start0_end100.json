            "To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of patches**: \n   The garden is 63 feet by 49 feet, and each patch is 7 feet by 7 feet. \n   - The number of patches along the length (63 feet) is \\( \\frac{63}{7} = 9 \\).\n   - The number of patches along the width (49 feet) is \\( \\frac{49}{7} = 7 \\).\n   - Therefore, the total number of patches is \\( 9 \\times 7 = 63 \\).\n\n2. **Identify the conditions for planting**: \n   We need to plant one patch of roses and one patch of mint such that they do not touch each other. Patches can touch either by the side or by the corner.\n\n3. **Choose the first patch**: \n   We can choose any of the 63 patches for the roses. \n\n4. **Determine the restricted patches for the mint**: \n   When we choose a patch for the roses, we need to identify which patches are restricted for the mint. \n   - If the roses are planted in a patch, the adjacent patches (including diagonally) cannot be used for the mint. \n   - Each patch can have up to 8 adjacent patches (4 sides and 4 corners), but this number can be less for patches on the edges or corners of the garden.\n\n5. **Count the restricted patches**: \n   - For a patch not on the edge or corner, there are 8 adjacent patches.\n   - For a patch on the edge (but not a corner), there are 5 adjacent patches.\n   - For a corner patch, there are 3 adjacent patches.\n\n6. **Calculate the total number of valid combinations**: \n   - We will consider the number of ways to choose the first patch and then subtract the restricted patches for the second patch.\n   - For each of the 63 patches, we will calculate the number of valid patches left for the mint.\n\n7. **Summarize the calculations**:\n   - For the 4 corner patches: Each has 3 restricted patches. So, for each corner patch, there are \\( 63 - 1 - 3 = 59 \\) valid patches for mint.\n   - For the 22 edge patches (not corners): Each has 5 restricted patches. So, for each edge patch, there are \\( 63 - 1 - 5 = 57 \\) valid patches for mint.\n   - For the 37 inner patches: Each has 8 restricted patches. So, for each inner patch, there are \\( 63 - 1 - 8 = 54 \\) valid patches for mint.\n\n8. **Calculate the total valid combinations**:\n   - Total combinations from corner patches: \\( 4 \\times 59 = 236 \\).\n   - Total combinations from edge patches: \\( 22 \\times 57 = 1254 \\).\n   - Total combinations from inner patches: \\( 37 \\times 54 = 1998 \\).\n\n9. **Add all valid combinations**:\n   - Total valid combinations = \\( 236 + 1254 + 1998 = 3488 \\).\n\nThus, the total number of ways to plant one patch of roses and one patch of mint such that they do not touch each other is:\n\nAnswer: 3488"

            "To solve the problem, we need to find the number of distinct 3-digit numbers \\(abc\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are digits satisfying the conditions \\(1 \\leq a < b < c \\leq 9\\). \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the constraints\n- The digits \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) must be distinct and in increasing order.\n- The smallest digit \\(a\\) can take values from 1 to 7 (since \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) must be greater than \\(a\\)).\n- The largest digit \\(c\\) can take values from 3 to 9 (since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be less than \\(c\\)).\n\n### Step 2: Choosing the digits\nSince \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) must be distinct and in increasing order, we can think of this as choosing 3 different digits from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Counting the combinations\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 distinct digits from 9 digits is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn our case, \\(n = 9\\) (the digits 1 through 9) and \\(k = 3\\) (we want to choose 3 digits). Thus, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 84\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring the product condition\nThe product \\((a-1)(b-1)(c-1)\\) must not equal zero. This condition is satisfied as long as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are chosen from the digits 1 to 9, since \\(a\\) will always be at least 1, making \\(a-1\\) at least 0. However, since \\(a\\) must be at least 1, \\(b\\) at least 2, and \\(c\\) at least 3, the product will never be zero for valid choices of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the total number of distinct, valid 3-digit numbers \\(abc\\) that can be chosen for this competition is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } 84\n\\]"

            "To solve the problem, we need to visualize the arrangement of the circular garden and the rectangular flower beds. \n\n1. **Understanding the Garden and Flower Beds**:\n   - The circular garden has a radius of \\(10\\) feet.\n   - The flower beds are rectangles with dimensions \\(5\\) feet (width) and \\(20\\sqrt{3}\\) feet (length).\n\n2. **Positioning the Flower Beds**:\n   - The problem states that the middle points of the longer sides of the rectangles are tangent to the circular garden. This means that the distance from the center of the circular garden to the midpoint of the longer side of the rectangle is equal to the radius of the garden plus half the width of the rectangle.\n\n3. **Calculating the Distance**:\n   - The radius of the garden is \\(10\\) feet.\n   - The width of the rectangle is \\(5\\) feet, so half the width is \\(\\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\\) feet.\n   - Therefore, the distance from the center of the garden to the midpoint of the longer side of the rectangle is:\n     \\[\n     10 + 2.5 = 12.5 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Arrangement**:\n   - The longer side of the rectangle is \\(20\\sqrt{3}\\) feet.

The number of seeds planted on the \\( n \\)-th day can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d = 1 + (n - 1) \\cdot 2 = 2n - 1\n\\]\n\nThe total number of seeds planted by the \\( n \\)-th day, \\( S_n \\), is the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of the arithmetic sequence:\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (a_1 + a_n) = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (1 + (2n - 1)) = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (2n) = n^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the day when total seeds exceed the area\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that:\n\\[\nS_n > A\n\\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[\nn^2 > 200\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\\[\nn > \\sqrt{200} \\approx 14.14\n\\]\nSince \\( n \\) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:\n\\[\nn = 15\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the total number of seeds planted will exceed the area of the garden on the 15th day.\n\nAnswer: 15",

4ac = 36^2 - 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot (-32) = 1296 + 640 = 1936\n   \\]\n   The discriminant is correct.\n\n   Let's solve it again:\n   \\[\n   w = \\frac{-36 + 44}{10} = \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \\quad \\text{(not valid)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   w = \\frac{-36 -

            "To solve the problem step by step, we need to find the expected position of the gold medals when they are arranged in a line with the condition that no two gold medals are adjacent.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the total number of medals\nWe have:\n- 5 gold medals\n- 7 silver medals\n\nTotal medals = 5 + 7 = 12.\n\n### Step 2: Arrange the silver medals\nFirst, we arrange the 7 silver medals. This creates 8 potential slots for the gold medals (one before each silver medal, one after the last silver medal):\n\n```\n_ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _\n```\n\nHere, \"S\" represents a silver medal, and \"_\" represents a potential slot for a gold medal. \n\n### Step 3: Place the gold medals\nWe need to place 5 gold medals in these 8 slots, ensuring that no two gold medals are adjacent. This can be done by choosing 5 slots out of the 8 available slots.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 slots from 8 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nIn our case, \\( n = 8 \\) and \\( k = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{5} = \\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the expected position of the gold medals\nNext, we need to find the expected position of the gold medals. The positions of the gold medals can be represented by the slots they occupy. \n\nThe slots are numbered from 1 to 12, and the positions of the gold medals can be any combination of 5 slots chosen from the 8 available slots. \n\nThe average position of the gold medals can be calculated by considering the average of the positions of the slots they occupy.

            "To solve the problem of how many distinct paths the magical frog can take to reach the point (4,3) while avoiding the barrier where x+y=5, we can break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Movement**: The frog can move right (increase x) or up (increase y). To reach (4,3), the frog must make a total of 4 right moves and 3 up moves, which means it will make a total of 7 moves.\n\n2. **Calculating Total Paths Without Barriers**: If there were no barriers, the number of distinct paths to (4,3) can be calculated using combinations. The total number of ways to arrange 4 right moves (R) and 3 up moves (U) in a sequence of 7 moves is given by the formula for combinations:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total paths} = \\binom{7}{4} = \\frac{7!}{4!3!} = 35\n   \\]\n\n3. **Identifying the Barrier**: The barrier is at points where x+y=5. The frog must avoid any path that passes through points (5,0), (4,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,4), and (0,5). However, since the frog is trying to reach (4,3), we need to check if any of the paths to (4,3) would cross the line x+y=5.\n\n4. **Finding Paths that Cross the Barrier**: The only point that could potentially be crossed is (2,3) because from (2,3), the frog could jump to (3,3) and then to (4,3). However, (2,3) does not cross the barrier since 2+3=5. Therefore, we need to check if the frog can reach (2,3) without crossing the barrier.\n\n5. **Calculating Paths to (2,3)**: The frog can reach (2,3) by making 2 right moves and 3 up moves. The number of distinct paths to (2,3) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Paths to (2,3)} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = 10\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculating Paths from (2,3) to (4,3)**: From (2,3), the frog can only move right to (3,3) and then to (4,3). There is only 1 way to do this (R, R).\n\n7. **Total Valid Paths**: Since there are 10 paths to (2,3) and 1 path from (2,3) to (4,3), the total number of valid paths to (4,3) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total valid paths} = 10 \\times 1 = 10\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of distinct paths the frog can take to reach (4,3) while avoiding the barrier is:\n\nAnswer: 10",

            "To solve the problem, we start with the given equation and inequality involving the complex number \\( z = a + bi \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers.\n\n1. **Understanding the equation**: The equation given is \n   \\[\n   |z|^2 + 2|z|x + x^2 = 100.\n   \\]\n   The modulus of the complex number \\( z \\) is given by \n   \\[\n   |z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \n   \\[\n   |z|^2 = a^2 + b^2.\n   \\]\n   Substituting this into the equation, we have:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 + 2\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}x + x^2 = 100.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rearranging the equation**: We can rearrange this to isolate the terms involving \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 + x^2 + 2x\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 100.\n   \\]\n   Let \\( r = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\), then the equation simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   r^2 + x^2 + 2xr = 100.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Completing the square**: We can complete the square for the terms involving \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   r^2 + (x + r)^2 = 100.\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   (x + r)^2 = 100 - r^2.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding the range for \\( r \\)**: Since \\( (x + r)^2 \\geq 0 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   100 - r^2 \\geq 0 \\implies r^2 \\leq 100 \\implies r \\leq 10.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( r \\) can take values from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 10 \\).\n\n5. **Finding \\( x \\)**: From the equation \\( (x + r)^2 = 100 - r^2 \\), we can take the square root:\n   \\[\n   x + r = \\sqrt{100 - r^2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x + r = -\\sqrt{100 - r^2}.\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   x = \\sqrt{100 - r^2} - r \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -\\sqrt{100 - r^2} - r.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Considering the inequality**: We also have the inequality \\( \\operatorname{Re}(z) > x \\), which means \\( a > x \\). Since \\( r = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\), we know \\( a \\leq r \\). Therefore, we need to ensure that \\( a > x \\).\n\n7. **Maximizing \\( x \\)**: To maximize \\( x \\), we consider the first case:\n   \\[\n   x = \\sqrt{100 - r^2} - r.\n   \\]\n   We want to maximize this expression. \n\n   Let's analyze the function:\n   \\[\n   f(r) = \\sqrt{100 - r^2} - r.\n   \\]\n   We can find the critical points by differentiating:\n   \\[\n   f'(r) = \\frac{-r}{\\sqrt{100 - r^2}} - 1.\n   \\]\n   Setting \\( f'(r) = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-r}{\\sqrt{100 - r^2}} - 1 = 0 \\implies \\frac{-r}{\\sqrt{100 - r^2}} = 1 \\implies -r = \\sqrt{100 - r^2}.\n   \\]\n   Squaring both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   r^2 = 100 - r^2 \\implies 2r^2 = 100 \\implies r^2 = 50 \\implies r = 5\\sqrt{2}.\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculating \\( x \\)**: Now substituting \\( r = 5\\sqrt{2} \\) back into the expression for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\sqrt{100 - (5\\sqrt{2})^2} - 5\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{100 - 50} - 5\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{50} - 5\\sqrt{2} = 5\\sqrt{2} - 5\\sqrt{2} = 0.\n   \\]\n\n9. **Finding maximum integer value**: We need to check the endpoints \\( r = 0 \\) and \\( r = 10 \\):\n   - For \\( r = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\sqrt{100 - 0^2} - 0 = 10.\n     \\]\n   - For \\( r = 10 \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\sqrt{100 - 10^2} - 10 = 0 - 10 = -10.\n     \\]\n\nThe maximum integer value of \\( x \\) occurs at \\( r = 0 \\), giving \\( x = 10 \\).\n\nThus, the maximum integer value that \\( x \\) can have is:\n\nAnswer: 10"

            "To solve the problem, we will first analyze the triangle with sides 9 cm, 40 cm, and 41 cm, and then consider the possible errors in measuring each side.\n\n### Step 1: Verify if the triangle is valid\nWe need to check if the sides 9 cm, 40 cm, and 41 cm can form a triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\n1. \\( 9 + 40 = 49 > 41 \\) (valid)\n2. \\( 9 + 41 = 50 > 40 \\) (valid)\n3. \\( 40 + 41 = 81 > 9 \\) (valid)\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, the triangle is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible errors\nEach side can either be 1 cm too long or 1 cm too short. Therefore, for each side, we have the following possible lengths:\n\n- For side 1 (9 cm): \n  - 8 cm (1 cm too short)\n  - 9 cm (correct)\n  - 10 cm (1 cm too long)\n\n- For side 2 (40 cm): \n  - 39 cm (1 cm too short)\n  - 40 cm (correct)\n  - 41 cm (1 cm too long)\n\n- For side 3 (41 cm): \n  - 40 cm (1 cm too short)\n  - 41 cm (correct)\n  - 42 cm (1 cm too long)\n\n### Step 3: List all combinations of side lengths\nNow we will list all combinations of the side lengths based on the possible errors:\n\n1. (8, 39, 40)\n2. (8, 39, 41)\n3. (8, 39, 42)\n4. (8, 40, 39)\n5. (8, 40, 40)\n6. (8, 40, 41)\n7. (8, 41, 40)\n8. (8, 41, 41)\n9. (8, 41, 42)\n10. (9, 39, 40)\n11. (9, 39, 41)\n12. (9, 39, 42)\n13.

(8, 39, 42): Valid\n4. (8, 40, 39): Valid\n5. (8, 40, 40): Valid\n6. (8, 40, 41): Valid\n7. (8, 41, 40): Valid\n8. (8, 41, 41): Valid\n9. (8, 41, 42): Valid\n10. (9, 39, 40): Valid\n11.

This means that the slope of the line from the origin to the point \\( (x,y) \\) on the hypotenuse must be \\( 1 \\) (since \\( \\tan(45^\\circ) = 1 \\)). Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   y = x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set the equations equal to find the intersection**: We substitute \\( y = x \\) into the hypotenuse equation:\n   \\[\n   x = -\\frac{3}{4}x + 3\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x + \\frac{3}{4}x = 3 \\implies \\frac{7}{4}x = 3 \\implies x = \\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{7} = \\frac{12}{7}\n   \\]\n   Now substituting back to find \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = x = \\frac{12}{7}\n   \\]\n   Thus, the point of intersection is \\( \\left(\\frac{12}{7}, \\frac{12}{7}\\right) \\).\n\n5. **Convert to polar coordinates**: The coordinates \\( \\left(\\frac{12}{7}, \\frac{12}{7}\\right) \\) can be converted to polar coordinates. The distance \\( r \\) from the origin is:\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{12}{7}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{12}{7}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{12}{7}\\right)^2} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7}\n   \\]\n   The angle \\( \\theta \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\theta = 45^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Use the logarithmic spiral equation**: The equation of the logarithmic spiral is given by:\n   \\[\n   r = ae^{b\\theta}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( r = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7} \\) and \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7} = ae^{b \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Find the value of \\( b \\)**: We need to find \\( b \\) such that the spiral passes through the point \\( (4,0) \\) as well. At \\( \\theta = 0 \\) (which corresponds to the point \\( (4,0) \\)):\n   \\[\n   r = ae^{b \\cdot 0} = a\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( a = 4 \\). Now substituting \\( a \\) back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7} = 4e^{b \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 4:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{28} = e^{b \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\implies \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{7} = e^{b \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n   \\]\n   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n   \\[\n   \\ln\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{7}\\right) = b \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{7}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculate \\( b \\)**: Using a calculator:\n   \\[\n   \\ln\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{7}\\right) \\approx \\ln(0.606) \\approx -0.494\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   b \\approx \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\cdot (-0.494) \\approx -0.629\n   \\]\n   Rounding to the nearest integer gives \\( b \\approx -1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: -1"

            "To solve the problem, we need to find the probability \\( p_n \\) that no two consecutive heads appear in the first \\( n \\) tosses of a fair coin. We can approach this problem using a recurrence relation.\n\n### Step 1: Define the probabilities\n\nLet:\n- \\( p_n \\) be the probability that no two consecutive heads appear in the first \\( n \\) tosses.\n\n### Step 2: Establish a recurrence relation\n\nWe can consider the outcomes of the first toss:\n1. If the first toss is a tail (T), then the remaining \\( n-1 \\) tosses can be any valid sequence of \\( n-1 \\) tosses, which contributes \\( p_{n-1} \\) to \\( p_n \\).\n2. If the first toss is a head (H), the second toss must be a tail (T) to avoid consecutive heads. The remaining \\( n-2 \\) tosses can be any valid sequence of \\( n-2 \\) tosses, which contributes \\( p_{n-2} \\) to \\( p_n \\).\n\nThus, we have the recurrence relation:\n\\[\np_n = p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Base cases\n\nWe need to establish base cases:\n- For \\( n = 1 \\): The possible outcomes are H and T.
