We can divide P(z) by (z+2):\nz\u00b3 - 3z + 2 = (z+2)(z\u00b2 - 2z + 1)\n\nThe quadratic factor z\u00b2 - 2z + 1 = (z-1)\u00b2 = 0\n\nTherefore, the roots are:\n* x = -2 (one root)\n* x = 1 (two roots, as it has multiplicity 2)\n\nThis completes our first step of finding all roots of P(z).",

            "Answer: 7\n\nExplanation: We found that 205 (5 \u00d7 41) is the smallest product of two distinct primes that is greater than 200. Therefore, we just need to sum its digits:\n2 + 0 + 5 = 7\n\nWe know this is correct because:\n1. We systematically checked products of primes starting with the smallest ones\n2. We found 205 as the first product exceeding 200\n3. Any other combinations would use larger primes, resulting in larger products\n4. Therefore, 205 is indeed the smallest such number\n5. The sum of its digits is 7"
