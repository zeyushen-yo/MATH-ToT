Also, if \\( k^3 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\), this implies \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\).

However, for our expression \\( k^3 - k \\), it simplifies using the fact that \\( k^3 - k = k(k^2 - 1) = k(k-1)(k+1) \\). The product of any three consecutive integers is always divisible by 3.

If \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\), try \\( k = 18 \\) (since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is even).\n\n### Step 3: Verify and check digit sum\n\n- \\( 18^3 - 18 = 5832 - 18 = 5814 \\).\n- Check divisibility:\n  - \\( 5814 \\div 9 = 646 \\) (exact division)\n  - \\( 5814 \\div 10 = 581.4 \\) (not an integer, but since 18 is checked for properties, it should be 0 modulo 10)\n\nNow, check the sum of the digits:\n\n- Digits of 18 are 1 and 8.\n- Sum of digits = 1 + 8 = 9 (which is not prime).\n\nRe-evaluate the smallest \\( k \\):\n\nSince 18 failed the digit sum check, try the next candidate \\( k = 90 \\) (a multiple of both 9 and 10).\n\n- \\( 90^3 - 90 = 729000 - 90 = 728910 \\).\n- Sum of digits of 90 = 9 (which is prime).\n\nSeeing as 90 does not satisfy this, let's try another number.\n\n### Double-check Candidates:\nUpon re-evaluation, \\( k = 45 \\) (since it's a multiple of 9).\n\n- \\( 45^3 - 45 = 91125 - 45 = 91080 \\).\n- \\( 91080 \\div 9 = 10120 \\) and \\( 91080 \\div 10 = 9108 \\).\n- Sum of digits of 45 = 4 + 5 = 9 (not prime, correct).\n\nRe-adjust choice until satisfied.

            "To solve the original problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( k^3 - k \\) is divisible by both \\( 9 \\) and \\( 10 \\), and the sum of the digits of \\( k \\) is a prime number.\n\n### Step 1: Divisibility by 9\nFor \\( k^3 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\), we can factor the expression:\n\\[ k^3 - k = k(k^2 - 1) = k(k-1)(k+1). \\]\n\nThe product \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\) represents three consecutive integers. Among any three consecutive integers, one must be divisible by 3. Therefore, \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) is always true.\n\nFor divisibility by 9, at least one of these factors must be divisible by 9, or two must be divisible by 3.

Since 10 factors into 2 and 5, we need:\n- One of the numbers \\( k, k-1, k+1 \\) to be even (divisible by 2).\n- One of the numbers \\( k, k-1, k+1 \\) to be divisible by 5.\n\n### Step 3: Determine

Therefore, twice the area is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Consecutive Even Numbers**\n\nLet the two consecutive even numbers be \\( x \\) and \\( x + 2 \\).\n\nThe product of these two numbers should be 48:\n\n\\[ x(x + 2) = 48 \\]\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 2x = 48 \\]\n\nRearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 2x - 48 = 0 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve the Quadratic Equation**\n\nTo solve the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + 2x - 48 = 0 \\), we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a} \\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), and \\( c = -48 \\).\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-48) = 4 + 192 = 196 \\]\n\nNow, compute the roots:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{196}}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{{-2 \\pm 14}}{2} \\]\n\nThe possible values for \\( x \\) are:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{{12}}{2} = 6 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{{-16}}{2} = -8 \\] (not applicable as lengths can't be negative)\n\nThus, \\( x = 6 \\).\n\nThen, the consecutive even numbers are \\( x = 6 \\) and \\( x + 2 = 8 \\).\n\n**Step 4: Determine Number of Unit Squares in the Right Triangle**\n\nThe legs of the right triangle are 6 and 8 units. The area of the right triangle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nSince the area of the triangle is already given as 24 square units, this confirms our solution. The number of unit squares (each with an area of 1 square unit) that can fit in the triangle is equal to the area itself, which is 24.\n\nTherefore, the number of unit squares that can fit in the triangle is 24.\n\nAnswer: 24"

Determine the length of the path (altitude) from the right angle to the hypotenuse:\n   The formula for the length of the altitude \\(h\\) from the right angle to the hypotenuse is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{a \\times b}{c}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the legs of the triangle, and \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.\n\n   Substituting the known values:\n\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{60 \\times 80}{100} = \\frac{4800}{100} = 48\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, the length of the path (altitude) is 48 feet.\n\n3. Calculate the number of lights needed if placed 5 feet apart:\n   To find the number of lights, divide the length of the path by the distance between the lights:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of lights} = \\frac{\\text{Length of path}}{\\text{Distance between lights}} = \\frac{48}{5} = 9.6\n   \\]\n\n   Since we cannot have a fraction of a light, we need to round up to the next whole number.

The expression becomes:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 6 + (3 - x) = x^2 - 5x + 9\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the minimum values of the expressions in each case, since we are looking for the maximum \\( m \\) that is less than or equal to these expressions for all \\( x \\).\n\n**Case 1**: \\( x^2 - 3x + 3 \\)\n\nTo find the minimum value, we complete the square:\n\\[\nx^2 - 3x + 3 = (x - \\frac{3}{2})^2 - \\frac{9}{4} + 3 = (x - \\frac{3}{2})^2 + \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nThe minimum value occurs at \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\), and the minimum value is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\n**Case 2**: \\( x^2 - 5x + 9 \\)\n\nAgain, complete the square:\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x + 9 = (x - \\frac{5}{2})^2 - \\frac{25}{4} + 9 = (x - \\frac{5}{2})^2 + \\frac{11}{4}\n\\]\n\nThe minimum value occurs at \\( x = \\frac{5}{2} \\), and the minimum value is \\(\\frac{11}{4}\\).\n\nNow, the overall minimum value of the expression \\( x^2 - 4x + 6 + |3 - x| \\) is given by the smaller of the two minimum values we calculated:\n\n\\[\n\\min\\left(\\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{11}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum integer \\( m \\) such that \\( m \\leq \\frac{3}{4} \\) is the largest integer less than or equal to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), which is 0.\n\nAnswer: 0"

            "To solve the original problem, we need to find the remainder when \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{49} (4n)!\\) is divided by \\(105\\).\n\nFirst, observe that \\(105 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\\).

            "To solve the original problem, we need to find the number of three-digit positive integers that are divisible by 5 and leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4.\n\nLet's denote the three-digit number as \\( n \\).

We need to determine the first ten positive integers divisible by 3 or 7, but not both, and then calculate their sum.\n\n### Step 1: Identify integers divisible by 3 and 7, but not both\n\n- **Divisible by 3 but not by 7:**\n  - These are numbers divisible by 3 but not by 21. The sequence starts: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, ...\n\n- **Divisible by 7 but not by 3:**\n  - These are numbers divisible by 7 but not by 21. The sequence starts: 7, 14, 28, 35, 49, 56, 63, ...\n\n### Step 2: List the first ten numbers\n\nWe need to select the first ten numbers from both sequences, ensuring no repetitions:\n\n- From numbers divisible by 3 but not 7: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 27, 30\n- From numbers divisible by 7 but not 3: 7\n\nCombining these gives us the first ten numbers: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 27, 30, 7\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the sum\n\nAdd the numbers from the combined list:\n\n\\[\n3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 24 + 27 + 30 + 7 = 151\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the tenth term \\(a_{10}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } 151\n\\]"

            "To solve the original problem, we will follow the step-by-step approach similar to the example solution provided.\n\n1. **Determine the Length of the Path**:\n   The path is constructed straight towards the hypotenuse from the right angle, dividing the original triangle into two smaller triangles. Since the path is straight towards the hypotenuse, we'll first determine its length. Since the original triangle is a right triangle with sides 60, 80, and hypotenuse 100, the path is the median to the hypotenuse, which is not explicitly given, so we'll assume the path extends to the hypotenuse forming two right-angled triangles.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Lights Needed**:\n   The number of lights needed depends on the length of the path. If we assume that the path divides the triangle equally and extends to the hypotenuse, we can use the properties of medians in a right triangle. The length of the median from the right angle to the hypotenuse of a right triangle can be calculated using:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of median} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2}}{2}\n   \\]\n   where \\(a = 60\\), \\(b = 80\\), and \\(c = 100\\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of median} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 \\times 60^2 + 2 \\times 80^2 - 100^2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7200 + 12800 - 10000}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10000}}{2} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n   \\]\n   Hence, the path is 50 feet long.\n\n   The lights are placed 5 feet apart:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of lights} = \\frac{50}{5} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\n   \\]\n   We add 1 because a light is placed at the starting point.\n\n3. **Determine the Areas of the Two Smaller Triangles**:\n   The path divides the original triangle into two smaller triangles. Assume each smaller triangle retains the geometric properties derived from the median split.\n\n   - **First Triangle**:\n     The area is half of the original triangle's area.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area of original triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 \\times 80 = 2400 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n     Each smaller triangle has an area:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area of each smaller triangle} = \\frac{2400}{2} = 1200 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Sum the Areas of the Two Smaller Triangles**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area} = 1200 + 1200 = 2400 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Sum of the Number of Lights and the Total Area**:\n   Adding the number of lights to the total area:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = 11 + 2400 = 2411\n   \\]\n\nThus, the sum of the number of lights and the total area of the two smaller triangles is \\(\\boxed{2411}\\).",

This creates 8 potential gaps (positions) where gold medals can be placed: before the first silver, between the silvers, and after the last silver.\n   - For 7 silver medals (S), the gap arrangement is: \\(_\\) S \\(_\\) S \\(_\\) S \\(_\\) ... \\(_\\) S \\(_\\).\n\n4. **Place Gold Medals in the Gaps:**\n   - We need to place 5 gold medals in these 8 gaps, ensuring that no two gold medals are adjacent.\n   - This can be done by choosing 5 gaps out of the 8 available, which can be done in \\(\\binom{8}{5}\\) ways.\n\n5. **Calculate Expected Mean Position:**\n   - Each valid arrangement of gold medals will have a certain mean position.\n   - Due to symmetry and uniform distribution of the possible gap choices, the expected mean position of the gold medals will be the average of all possible positions.\n\n6. **Positioning and Symmetry:**\n   - The positions of the medals are symmetric around the center.\n   - For any symmetric sequence, the expected mean position can be calculated directly as the median position of the entire sequence.\n   - The sequence is numbered from 1 to 12. The mean position of the gold medals is \\((1+12)/2 = 6.5\\).\n\nThus, the expected location that the teacher stands at is:\n\n\"Answer: 6.5\""

Thus, we require:\n   \\[\n   -5 \\leq \\frac{n}{2} \\leq 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -10 \\leq n \\leq 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate Minimum Value:**\n   We need to ensure that the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) at \\( x = \\frac{n}{2} \\) is non-negative:\n   \\[\n   f\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)^2 - n\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) + 240 = \\frac{n^2}{4} - \\frac{n^2}{2} + 240 = -\\frac{n^2}{4} + 240\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{n^2}{4} + 240 \\geq 0 \\Longrightarrow \\frac{n^2}{4} \\leq 240\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n^2 \\leq 960\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the Largest Integer \\( n \\):**\n   We require \\( n^2 \\leq 960 \\) and \\( n \\leq 20 \\). From the example, we know that when \\( n^2 < 960 \\), the largest integer \\( n \\) is 30; however, due to the constraint \\( n \\leq 20 \\), we have to check up to \\( n = 20 \\).\n\n6. **Verify \\( n = 20 \\):**\n   \\[\n   20^2 = 400 \\leq 960\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\( n = 20 \\) satisfies both the vertex condition and \\( n^2 \\leq 960 \\), it is the largest integer satisfying the problem's constraints.\n\nAnswer: 20",
            "To solve the original problem, we need to find the largest integer \\( n \\) such that the polynomial \\( f(x) = x^2 - nx + 240 \\) satisfies \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all real numbers \\(-5 \\leq x \\leq 10\\).\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Condition \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\):**\n   The polynomial \\( f(x) = x^2 - nx + 240 \\) should not have any roots in the interval \\([-5, 10]\\), meaning it must either be non-negative or have no real roots within this interval.\n\n2. **Discriminant and Vertex Considerations:**\n   The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) of the quadratic \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is given by \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\). For \\( f(x) \\) to have no real roots, \\(\\Delta < 0\\).\n\n   Here, we have:\n   \\[\n   a = 1, \\quad b = -n, \\quad c = 240\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = (-n)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 240 = n^2 - 960\n   \\]\n\n   For \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) on \\([-5, 10]\\), the discriminant should be non-positive:\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 960 \\leq 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n^2 \\leq 960\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the Largest Integer \\( n \\):**\n   Solve \\( n^2 \\leq 960 \\). The square root of 960 is approximately 30.98. Therefore, the largest integer \\( n \\) satisfying this inequality is \\( n = 30 \\).\n\n4. **Verify the Vertex Condition:**\n   The vertex of the parabola \\( x^2 - nx + 240 \\) is at \\( x = \\frac{n}{2} \\). Ensure the vertex is within the interval \\([-5, 10]\\) for the quadratic to be non-negative throughout:\n   \\[\n   -5 \\leq \\frac{n}{2} \\leq 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -10 \\leq n \\leq 20\n   \\]\n\n   Combine with \\( n \\leq \\sqrt{960} \\approx 30.98 \\), the largest integer satisfying both conditions is \\( n = 30 \\).\n\nThus, the largest integer \\( n \\) for which the polynomial satisfies \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\(-5 \\leq x \\leq 10\\) is:\n\n**Answer: 30**",

What must be the width of the path in meters?\n\n1. **Original Area of the Garden:**\n   The area of the rectangular garden is \\(30 \\times 40 = 1200\\) square meters.\n\n2. **Usable Area After Path Construction:**\n   The path consumes half of the garden's area, so the usable area is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1200}{2} = 600 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Understanding the Garden and Path Configuration:**\n   - Let the original dimensions of the rectangular garden be \\( L = 40 \\) meters and \\( W = 30 \\) meters.\n   - The path is constructed along the inside border of the garden with a uniform width \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Expression for Usable Area:**\n   - After the path is constructed, the dimensions of the usable area inside will be reduced by \\( 2x \\) on both dimensions (length and width).\n   - The new dimensions of the usable area are \\((40 - 2x)\\) and \\((30 - 2x)\\).\n\n5. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   The area of the usable garden after the path is constructed is: \n   \\[\n   (40 - 2x)(30 - 2x) = 600\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solving the Equation:**\n   Expand the equation:\n   \\[\n   (40 - 2x)(30 - 2x) = 600\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1200 - 80x - 60x + 4x^2 = 600\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4x^2 - 140x + 1200 = 600\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4x^2 - 140x + 600 = 0\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n   - Divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 35x + 150 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   - Use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -35 \\), and \\( c = 150 \\).\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-(-35) \\pm \\sqrt{(-35)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 150}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{35 \\pm \\sqrt{1225 - 600}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{35 \\pm \\sqrt{625}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{35 \\pm 25}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   - The solutions are:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{35 + 25}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{35 - 25}{2} = 5\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\( x = 30 \\) is not a feasible solution (as it would eliminate the garden entirely), the width of the path must be \\( x = 5 \\) meters.\n\nTherefore, the width of the path is 5 meters.\n\nAnswer: 5"
