However, 9 is not congruent to 0 modulo 10. \n\nTherefore, there is no way for the ball to return to the starting position after exactly 9 passes in a circle of 10 people. \n\nThus, the probability of the ball returning to the starting person after exactly 9 passes is 0.\n\nAnswer: 0",
            "Original Problem: A group of 10 friends decide to play a game where they sit in a circle and pass a ball to the person on their right. The game starts with the ball being given to a random person. What is the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after exactly 9 passes.\n\nIn a circle of 10 people, passing the ball to the right 9 times means the ball will have moved 9 positions clockwise. Therefore, for the ball to return to the starting person after 9 passes, we need the ball to have completed exactly one less than a full circle.\n\nWe consider the modular arithmetic of the circle positions. After 9 passes, the position of the ball can be described by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Starting position} + 9 \\equiv \\text{Starting position} \\pmod{10} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 9 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10} \\]\n\nThis equation is not true, as 9 is not congruent to 0 modulo 10. Hence, it is impossible for the ball to return to the starting person after exactly 9 passes.\n\nAnswer: 0",
            "To solve the original problem, we need to determine the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times in a circle of 10 people.\n\nIn a circle of 10 people, if the ball is passed to the right, after 9 passes, it will return to the starting person only if each person has received the ball exactly once, with the exception of the starting person receiving it twice (at the start and at the end of the 9 passes).\n\nSince there are 10 people, after 9 passes, the ball will have reached the person just before the starting person in the circle. Therefore, the ball cannot return to the starting person after exactly 9 passes, as it would need 10 passes to return to the starting position (one full circle).\n\nThus, the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after exactly 9 passes is 0.\n\nAnswer: 0",
            "In the original problem, the ball is passed 9 times among 10 friends sitting in a circle. To determine the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after exactly 9 passes, consider the following:\n\nWhen the ball is passed 9 times in a circle of 10 people, it effectively moves 9 positions to the right. For the ball to return to the starting person, it must complete a full circle or cycle through the entire group, which means it should have moved a multiple of 10 positions.\n\nHowever, since the ball is passed 9 times, this is not a complete cycle (which would be 10 passes, or any multiple of 10). Thus, after 9 passes, the ball cannot be back at the starting position.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times is 0.\n\nAnswer: 0",
            "To solve the original problem, we need to determine the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times in a circle of 10 people.\n\nWhen the ball is passed 9 times in a circle of 10 people, it effectively means the ball needs to make 9 moves. For the ball to return to the starting person, it must cover a total of 10 positions (one full cycle plus returning to the original position). However, since the total moves are only 9, the only way for the ball to return to the starting person is if it completes a full cycle and ends at the starting position.\n\nIn this scenario, the ball is passed around the circle, and since each person passes the ball to the person on their right, after 9 passes, the ball will end up one person short of the full circle. Therefore, it will return to the person immediately to the left of the starting position, not the starting person.\n\nSince there is no scenario in which the ball returns to the starting person after exactly 9 passes, the probability of the ball returning to the starting person under these conditions is 0.\n\nAnswer: 0",

The sum of the digits of \\( k \\) is a prime number.\n\nFirst, consider the condition \\( k^3 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\). Notice that:\n\n\\[\nk^3 - k = k(k^2 - 1) = k(k-1)(k+1)\n\\]\n\nThis is the product of three consecutive integers, so at least one of them is divisible by 3. Therefore, \\( k^3 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) is always true.\n\nFor divisibility by 9, check small values of \\( k \\) manually:\n\n- \\( k = 0 \\): \\( 0^3 - 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k = 1 \\): \\( 1^3 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k = 2 \\): \\( 2^3 - 2 = 6 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k = 3 \\): \\( 3^3 - 3 = 24 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k = 4 \\): \\( 4^3 - 4 = 60 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k = 5 \\): \\( 5^3 - 5 = 120 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k = 6 \\): \\( 6^3 - 6 = 210 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k = 7 \\): \\( 7^3 - 7 = 336 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\)\n- \\( k = 8 \\): \\( 8^3 - 8 = 504 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\)\n\nThus, \\( k \\equiv 0, 1, 8 \\pmod{9} \\).\n\nNext, consider the condition \\( k^3 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10} \\). This requires that \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10} \\). For this to hold:\n\n- \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2} \\) (since \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\) includes an even number)\n- \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\) (since one of these three consecutive numbers must be divisible by 5)\n\nTherefore, \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10} \\).\n\nCombining the conditions, we have \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{90} \\).\n\nFinally, find the smallest \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{90} \\) such that the sum of its digits is prime. The smallest such \\( k \\) is 90. The sum of the digits of 90 is \\( 9 + 0 = 9 \\), which is not prime.\n\nCheck \\( k = 180 \\).

Therefore, \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10} \\). For divisibility by 10, one of these must be divisible by both 2 and 5. Thus, \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2} \\) or \\( \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\nSince we need \\( k^3 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{90} \\), we combine these conditions:\n- \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2} \\) or \\( \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\)\n- At least one of \\( k, k-1, k+1 \\) is divisible by 9.\n\nLet's try small values of \\( k \\) to satisfy these conditions and check if the sum of its digits is a prime number:\n\n- **\\( k = 0 \\):** Trivial, not positive.\n- **\\( k = 1 \\):** \\( k^3 - k = 0 \\).

The maximum number of cakes that can be made is determined by the limiting ingredient, which is the one that allows for the fewest cakes. Here, it's the eggs, which allow for approximately 31.43 cakes.\n\nSince we cannot make a fraction of a cake while maintaining the ratio, the maximum number of complete cakes is 31.\n\nAnswer: 31",
            "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many 1 kg cakes can be made with the given ingredients while maintaining the ratio of 3:1:7 for flour, sugar, and eggs.\n\n1. **Determine the total parts in the ratio**:  \n   The ratio of flour:sugar:eggs is 3:1:7, which gives a total of \\(3 + 1 + 7 = 11\\) parts.\n\n2. **Calculate the weight of each part**:  \n   Since one cake weighs 1 kg, each part in the ratio corresponds to \\(\\frac{1}{11}\\) kg.\n\n3. **Calculate the ingredient requirements per cake**:  \n   - Flour required per cake = 3 parts = \\(3 \\times \\frac{1}{11} = \\frac{3}{11}\\) kg\n   - Sugar required per cake = 1 part = \\(\\frac{1}{11}\\) kg\n   - Eggs required per cake = 7 parts = \\(7 \\times \\frac{1}{11} = \\frac{7}{11}\\) kg\n\n4. **Determine maximum number of cakes from each ingredient**:  \n   - From 40 kg of flour:  \n     Max cakes = \\( \\frac{40}{\\frac{3}{11}} = 40 \\times \\frac{11}{3} = \\frac{440}{3} \\approx 146.67\\)\n   - From 10 kg of sugar:  \n     Max cakes = \\( \\frac{10}{\\frac{1}{11}} = 10 \\times 11 = 110\\)\n   - From 20 kg of eggs:  \n     Max cakes = \\( \\frac{20}{\\frac{7}{11}} = 20 \\times \\frac{11}{7} = \\frac{220}{7} \\approx 31.43\\)\n\n5. **Determine the limiting ingredient**:  \n   The limiting ingredient is the one that allows the fewest number of cakes. Comparing the maximum number of cakes from each ingredient:\n   - Flour allows for approximately 146 cakes.\n   - Sugar allows for 110 cakes.\n   - Eggs allow for approximately 31 cakes.\n\nThe limiting factor is the eggs, which allow for only 31 cakes.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of cakes that can be made is 31.\n\n**Answer: 31**"
