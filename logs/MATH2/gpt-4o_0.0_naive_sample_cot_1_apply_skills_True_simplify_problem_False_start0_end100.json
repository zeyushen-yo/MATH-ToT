Since they are consecutive integers, if \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\), then \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\) will ensure divisibility by 9.\n\n### Step 2: Divisibility by 10\nFor \\( k^3 - k \\) to be divisible by 10, it must be divisible by both 2 and 5. Since \\( k(k-1)(k+1) \\) includes three consecutive integers, one of them is even, ensuring divisibility by 2. For divisibility by 5, one of these integers must be divisible by 5.\n\n### Step 3: Combine Conditions\nWe need \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\) and \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\). The least common multiple of 9 and 5 is 45, so \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{45} \\).\n\n### Step 4: Sum of Digits is Prime\nWe need to find the smallest \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{45} \\) such that the sum of its digits is a prime number. Let's check the smallest multiples of 45:\n\n- \\( k = 45 \\): Sum of digits = 4 + 5 = 9 (not prime)\n- \\( k = 90 \\): Sum of digits = 9 + 0 = 9 (not prime)\n- \\( k = 135 \\): Sum of digits = 1 + 3

            "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many different bracelets can be made using a continuous sequence of exactly 6 beads from the infinite series, such that the perimeter of the bracelet is an integer value. Each bead has a length of 0.5 units, so the total length of the bracelet will be 6 * 0.5 = 3 units. We need this length to be an integer, which it already is (3 units).\n\nNow, let's analyze the pattern of the beads:\n\n1. The sequence of beads follows the pattern of powers of 2:\n   - Red: 2, 16, 64, ...\n   - Blue: 4, 32, 128, ...\n   - Green: 8, 64, 256, ...\n\n2. The sequence of colors is Red, Blue, Green, and repeats indefinitely.\n\n3. We need to find all possible sequences of 6 beads that can be selected from this pattern.\n\nLet's break down the sequence of beads:\n\n- The first red section has 2 beads.\n- The first blue section has 4 beads.\n- The first green section has 8 beads.\n- The second red section has 16 beads.\n- The second blue section has 32 beads.\n- The second green section has 64 beads.\n\nThe sequence of colors and their respective bead counts is as follows:\n- Red (2), Blue (4), Green (8), Red (16), Blue (32), Green (64), ...\n\nTo find all possible sequences of 6 beads, we need to consider the starting point and the number of beads in each section:\n\n1. Starting with Red (2 beads):\n   - We can take 2 Red beads and 4 Blue beads.\n   - We can take 2 Red beads, 4 Blue beads, and 0 Green beads.\n\n2. Starting with Blue (4 beads):\n   - We can take 4 Blue beads and 2 Green beads.\n   - We can take 4 Blue beads, 2 Green beads, and 0 Red beads.\n\n3. Starting with Green (8 beads):\n   - We can take 6 Green beads.\n\nNow, let's count the number of different bracelets:\n\n- From the Red section, we can have:\n  - 2 Red, 4 Blue (1 way)\n  - 2 Red, 4 Blue, 0 Green (1 way)\n\n- From the Blue section, we can have:\n  - 4 Blue, 2 Green (1 way)\n  - 4 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red (1 way)\n\n- From the Green section, we can have:\n  - 6 Green (1 way)\n\nIn total, there are 5 different ways to select 6 beads from the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the number of different bracelets that can be made is 5.\n\nAnswer: 5"

            "To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of adding water to the container and how it relates to a geometric series.\n\nInitially, the container has 500 mL of water. Every minute, the scientist adds water equal to half of the current amount. We need to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the total amount of water in liters is never in the interval \\([n, n+1]\\).\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Amount**: The container starts with 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters.\n\n2. **Water Added Each Minute**: \n   - At minute 1, the scientist adds \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.5 = 0.25 \\) liters.\n   - At minute 2, the scientist adds \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.75 = 0.375 \\) liters.\n   - At minute 3, the scientist adds \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.125 = 0.5625 \\) liters.\n   - This pattern continues, with each addition being half of the current total.\n\n3. **Total Water After Each Minute**:\n   - After 1 minute: \\( 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75 \\) liters.\n   - After 2 minutes: \\( 0.75 + 0.375 = 1.125 \\) liters.\n   - After 3 minutes: \\( 1.125 + 0.5625 = 1.6875 \\) liters.\n   - This forms a geometric series.\n\n4. **Geometric Series**:\n   - The total amount of water after \\( n \\) minutes can be expressed as a geometric series:\n     \\[\n     S_n = 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + \\ldots\n     \\]\n   - This is a geometric series with the first term \\( a = 0.5 \\) and common ratio \\( r = 1.5 \\).\n\n5. **Sum of the Infinite Series**:\n   - The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} = \\frac{0.5}{1 - 0.5} = 1\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total amount of water approaches 1 liter as time goes to infinity.\n\n6. **Finding \\( n \\)**:\n   - We need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the total amount of water never reaches the interval \\([n, n+1]\\).\n   - Since the total amount of water approaches 1 liter, it will never reach or exceed 1 liter.\n   - Therefore, the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the total amount of water is never in the interval \\([n, n+1]\\) is \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1"

            "To solve the problem of finding the remainder when \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{49} (4n)!\\) is divided by 105, we can use modular arithmetic and divisibility rules. The number 105 can be factored into its prime components: \\(105 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\\). We will find the remainder of the sum modulo each of these factors and then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the overall remainder modulo 105.\n\n### Step 1: Modulo 3\nFor any \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\(4n\\) is at least 8, and \\(8!\\) contains the factor 3. Therefore, for \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\((4n)!\\) is divisible by 3. The only term we need to check is when \\(n = 1\\), which gives us \\((4 \\times 1)! = 4! = 24\\). The remainder of 24 when divided by 3 is 0. Thus, the sum \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{49} (4n)!\\) is congruent to 0 modulo 3.\n\n### Step 2: Modulo 5\nFor any \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\(4n\\) is at least 8, and \\(8!\\) contains the factor 5. Therefore, for \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\((4n)!\\) is divisible by 5. The only term we need to check is when \\(n = 1\\), which gives us \\((4 \\times 1)! = 4! = 24\\). The remainder of 24 when divided by 5 is 4. Thus, the sum \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{49} (4n)!\\) is congruent to 4 modulo 5.\n\n### Step 3: Modulo 7\nFor any \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\(4n\\) is at least 8, and \\(8!\\) contains the factor 7. Therefore, for \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\((4n)!\\) is divisible by 7. The only term we need to check is when \\(n = 1\\), which gives us \\((4 \\times 1)! = 4! = 24\\). The remainder of 24 when divided by 7 is 3. Thus, the sum \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{49} (4n)!\\) is congruent to 3 modulo 7.\n\n### Step 4: Combine using the Chinese Remainder Theorem\nWe have the following system of congruences:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}, \\\\\nx &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}, \\\\\nx &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo solve this, we first solve the congruences modulo 5 and 7. We need to find \\(x\\) such that:\n\\[\nx \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the method of successive substitutions, we start with \\(x = 5k + 4\\) and substitute into the second congruence:\n\\[\n5k + 4 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\implies 5k \\equiv -1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}.\n\\]\n\nThe inverse of 5 modulo 7 is 3 (since \\(5 \\times 3 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\\)), so:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 6 \\times 3 \\equiv 18 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(k = 7m + 4\\) for some integer \\(m\\), and substituting back gives:\n\\[\nx = 5(7m + 4) + 4 = 35m + 20 + 4 = 35m + 24.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(x \\equiv 24 \\pmod{35}\\).\n\nNow, we solve the congruence:\n\\[\nx \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x \\equiv 24 \\pmod{35}.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 35n + 24\\) into the first congruence:\n\\[\n35n + 24 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(35 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\) and \\(24 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\), we have:\n\\[\n2n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\), so \\(n = 3p\\) for some integer \\(p\\). Substituting back gives:\n\\[\nx = 35(3p) + 24 = 105p + 24.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(x \\equiv 24 \\pmod{105}\\).\n\nThus, the remainder when \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{49} (4n)!\\) is divided by 105 is \\(\\boxed{24}\\)."

Therefore, \\( x^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10} \\).\n   - This implies \\( x(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10} \\).\n   - Since \\( x \\) and \\( x-1 \\) are consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 2 and the other by 5. Thus, \\( x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2} \\) or \\( x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\) and \\( x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\) or \\( x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\n2. **Divisibility by 7:**\n   - A number is divisible by 7 if \\( x^2 - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\).\n   - This implies \\( x(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\).\n   - Therefore, either \\( x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\) or \\( x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\n3. **Combining conditions:**\n   - We need \\( x(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{70} \\).\n   - We will check small values of \\( x \\) to find the smallest one that satisfies both conditions.\n\nLet's test small values of \\( x \\):\n\n- \\( x = 2 \\):\n  - \\( x^2 - x = 2^2 - 2 = 2 \\), not divisible by 70.\n\n- \\( x = 3 \\):\n  - \\( x^2 - x = 3^2 - 3 = 6 \\), not divisible by 70.\n\n- \\( x = 4 \\):\n  - \\( x^2 - x = 4^2 - 4 = 12 \\), not divisible by 70.\n\n- \\( x = 5 \\):\n  - \\( x^2 - x = 5^2 - 5 = 20 \\), not divisible by 70.\n\n- \\( x = 6 \\):\n  - \\( x^2 - x = 6^2 - 6 = 30 \\), not divisible by 70.\n\n- \\( x = 7 \\):\n  - \\( x^2 - x = 7^2 - 7 = 42 \\), not divisible by 70.\n\n- \\( x = 8 \\):\n  - \\( x^2 - x = 8^2 - 8 = 56 \\), not divisible by 70.\n\n- \\( x = 9 \\):\n  - \\( x^2 - x = 9^2 - 9 = 72 \\), not divisible by 70.\n\n- \\( x = 10 \\):\n  - \\( x^2 - x = 10^2 - 10 = 90 \\), not divisible by 70.\n\n- \\( x = 14 \\):\n  - \\( x^2 - x = 14^2 - 14 = 196 \\), divisible by 70.\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( x > 1 \\) such that \\( x^2 - x \\) is divisible by both 10 and 7 is \\( x = 14 \\).\n\nAnswer: 14"

This implies that the tiles are placed diagonally.\n\n3. **Calculate the effective coverage of a diagonally placed tile:**\n   - When a square tile is placed at a 45-degree angle, it forms a diamond shape.\n   - The diagonal of a 1-meter square tile is given by the formula for the diagonal of a square:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Diagonal} = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\text{side} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 1 = \\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n   - The effective coverage of the tile in terms of the field's grid is a square with side \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n4. **Determine the number of tiles that can fit:**\n   - The field is 10 meters by 20 meters.\n   - Along the width (10 meters), the number of tiles that can fit is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\approx 7.07\n     \\]\n   - Along the length (20 meters), the number of tiles that can fit is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 10\\sqrt{2} \\approx 14.14\n     \\]\n   - Since we cannot have a fraction of a tile, we take the floor of these values:\n     - Along the width: 7 tiles\n     - Along the length: 14 tiles\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of tiles and the tiled area:**\n   - Total number of tiles = 7 (width) \\(\\times\\) 14 (length) = 98 tiles\n   - Each tile covers 1 square meter, so the tiled area is 98 square meters.\n\n6. **Calculate the grassy area:**\n   - The total area of the field is 200 square meters.\n   - The tiled area is 98 square meters.\n   - Therefore, the grassy area is:\n     \\[\n     200 - 98 = 102 \\text{ square meters}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the minimum area of the grassy regions of the field is 102 square meters.\n\nAnswer: 102"

            "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that a randomly selected student correctly answered at least one question of each type: multiple-choice, true or false, and numerical-answer questions. We know that on average, each type of question was answered correctly by 60% of the students.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Probability for Each Type of Question:**\n   - For each type of question, the probability that a student answers a question correctly is 60%, or 0.6.\n\n2. **Probability of Answering All Questions Incorrectly for Each Type:**\n   - **Multiple-choice questions:** There are 5 questions. The probability of answering a single question incorrectly is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. Therefore, the probability of answering all 5 questions incorrectly is \\(0.4^5\\).\n   - **True or false questions:** Similarly, the probability of answering all 5 questions incorrectly is \\(0.4^5\\).\n   - **Numerical-answer questions:** Again, the probability of answering all 5 questions incorrectly is \\(0.4^5\\).\n\n3. **Probability of Answering at Least One Question Correctly for Each Type:**\n   - The probability of answering at least one question correctly for each type is the complement of answering all questions incorrectly.\n   - Therefore, for each type, the probability is \\(1 - 0.4^5\\).\n\n4. **Probability of Answering at Least One Question Correctly for All Types:**\n   - Since the events of answering at least one question correctly for each type are independent, we multiply the probabilities:\n   \\[\n   (1 - 0.4^5) \\times (1 - 0.4^5) \\times (1 - 0.4^5)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - First, calculate \\(0.4^5\\):\n     \\[\n     0.4^5 = 0.01024\n     \\]\n   - Then, calculate \\(1 - 0.4^5\\):\n     \\[\n     1 - 0.01024 = 0.98976\n     \\]\n   - Finally, calculate the overall probability:\n     \\[\n     0.98976 \\times 0.98976 \\times 0.98976 \\approx 0.969\n     \\]\n\n6. **Round the Probability to the Nearest Whole Number:**\n   - The probability rounded to the nearest whole number is 97%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected student correctly answered at least one of each type of question is approximately 97%.\n\nAnswer: 97"

            "To solve the problem, we need to find three-digit positive integers that satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. The integer is divisible by 5.\n2. When divided by 4, the remainder is 3.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the conditions\n\n- **Divisibility by 5**: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5.\n- **Remainder when divided by 4 is 3**: This means if the number is \\( n \\), then \\( n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Combine the conditions\n\nWe need numbers that satisfy both conditions. Let's consider numbers ending in 0 and 5 separately:\n\n#### Case 1: Numbers ending in 0\n\n- If a number ends in 0, it is divisible by 5.\n- However, if a number ends in 0, it is divisible by 4 (since 10 is divisible by 4), so the remainder when divided by 4 is 0, not 3. Therefore, numbers ending in 0 do not satisfy the second condition.\n\n#### Case 2: Numbers ending in 5\n\n- If a number ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.\n- We need to check if such a number gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 4. \n\nLet's express a number ending in 5 as \\( n = 10k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n- We need \\( 10k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\).\n\nCalculate \\( 10k + 5 \\mod 4 \\):\n\n\\[\n10k + 5 \\equiv 2k + 1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n2k + 1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\implies 2k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}\n\\]\n\nDivide the entire equation by 2:\n\n\\[\nk \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}\n\\]\n\nThis means \\( k \\) is odd.\n\n### Step 3: Find the range of \\( k \\)\n\nSince we are looking for three-digit numbers, we have:\n\n- The smallest three-digit number is 100.\n- The largest three-digit number is 999.\n\nFor numbers ending in 5, the smallest is 105 and the largest is 995.\n\nExpress these in terms of \\( k \\):\n\n- \\( 10k + 5 = 105 \\) gives \\( k = 10 \\).\n- \\( 10k + 5 = 995 \\) gives \\( k = 99 \\).\n\nSince \\( k \\) must be odd, we consider the odd numbers from 11 to 99.\n\n### Step 4: Count the odd numbers from 11 to 99\n\nThe sequence of odd numbers from 11 to 99 is an arithmetic sequence where:\n\n- First term \\( a_1 = 11 \\)\n- Last term \\( a_n = 99 \\)\n- Common difference \\( d = 2 \\)\n\nThe number of terms \\( n \\) in this sequence is given by:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n\\]\n\n\\[\n99 = 11 + (n-1) \\cdot 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n99 - 11 = (n-1) \\cdot 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n88 = (n-1) \\cdot 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn-1 = 44\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 45\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 45 odd numbers from 11 to 99.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of three-digit integers that are divisible by 5 and leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 is 45.\n\n**Answer: 45**"

The 100 feet side is the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are the legs of the triangle.\n\n2. **Determine the Path and its Length:**\n   - The path is constructed from the right angle to the hypotenuse, dividing the triangle into two smaller right-angled triangles. Since the path is perpendicular to the hypotenuse, it acts as the height of the original triangle when considering the hypotenuse as the base.\n\n3. **Calculate the Length of the Path:**\n   - The area of the original triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a right triangle: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 \\times 80 = 2400 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n   - The area can also be expressed using the hypotenuse and the height (path length \\( h \\)):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 \\times h = 2400\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( h \\):\n     \\[\n     50h = 2400 \\implies h = \\frac{2400}{50} = 48 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Lights:**\n   - Lights are placed every 5 feet along the path.

Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of positions and medals:**\n   - There are 12 positions in total (5 gold + 7 silver).\n\n2. **Arrange the silver medals:**\n   - First, place the 7 silver medals. This creates 8 gaps (including the ends) where the gold medals can be placed: _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _.\n\n3. **Place the gold medals:**\n   - We need to place 5 gold medals in these 8 gaps such that no two gold medals are adjacent. This is equivalent to choosing 5 gaps out of the 8 available to place a gold medal.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of ways to choose the gaps:**\n   - The number of ways to choose 5 gaps from 8 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{8}{5} \\), which is equal to \\( \\binom{8}{3} = 56 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the mean position of the gold medals:**\n   - For each valid configuration, calculate the mean position of the gold medals. The positions of the gold medals will vary depending on which gaps are chosen.\n\n6. **Calculate the expected mean position:**\n   - Since each configuration is equally likely, the expected mean position is the average of the mean positions over all valid configurations.\n\nTo simplify the calculation, note that the positions of the gold medals are symmetrically distributed around the center of the lineup. Therefore, the expected mean position of the gold medals will be the mean of the positions 1 to 12, which is the center of the lineup.\n\n7. **Calculate the mean of positions 1 to 12:**\n   - The mean position of positions 1 to 12 is \\( \\frac{1 + 12}{2} = 6.5 \\).\n\nThus, the expected location that the teacher stands at is position 6.5.\n\nAnswer: 6.5"

For example, 6 is square-free because its prime factors are 2 and 3, and neither is repeated. However, 12 is not square-free because it is divisible by \\( 2^2 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Arranging coins into piles with distinct prime numbers**\n\nWe need to find three distinct prime numbers \\( p_1, p_2, \\) and \\( p_3 \\) such that their sum \\( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = n \\).\n\n**Step 3: Finding the smallest \\( n \\)**\n\nWe start with the smallest prime numbers and check their sums:\n\n- The smallest three distinct primes are 2, 3, and 5. Their sum is:\n  \\[\n  2 + 3 + 5 = 10\n  \\]\n  We need to check if 10 is square-free. The prime factorization of 10 is \\( 2 \\times 5 \\), which is square-free.\n\n- Next, we check if there is a smaller \\( n \\) by considering other combinations of small primes:\n  - 2, 3, and 7: \\( 2 + 3 + 7 = 12 \\) (not smaller than 10)\n  - 2, 5, and 7: \\( 2 + 5 + 7 = 14 \\) (not smaller than 10)\n  - 3, 5, and 7: \\( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \\) (not smaller than 10)\n\nSince 10 is the smallest sum of three distinct primes and is square-free, it is the smallest \\( n \\) that satisfies the conditions.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe smallest positive square-free integer \\( n \\) greater than 1 such that \\( n \\) coins can be arranged into three piles, each containing a distinct prime number of coins, is 10.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: 10}\n\\]"

Therefore, the number of drones required is calculated by dividing the total number of toys by the capacity of each drone:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of drones} = \\frac{360 \\text{ toys}}{12 \\text{ toys/drone}} = 30 \\text{ drones}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the time each drone takes to reach the retailer.**\n\nThe parametric equations for the path of each drone are given as \\((x(t), y(t)) = (3t, 5t)\\).

            "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum area of a rectangle that can fit inside an ellipse and then calculate the perimeter of that rectangle, which will give us the length of the fencing material required.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have an ellipse with a major axis of 10 meters and a minor axis of 8 meters.\n   - The equation of the ellipse in standard form is \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\), where \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis and \\(b\\) is the semi-minor axis.\n   - Here, \\(a = 5\\) meters and \\(b = 4\\) meters.\n\n2. **Set Up the Rectangle:**\n   - We want to inscribe a rectangle within this ellipse such that its sides are parallel to the axes of the ellipse.\n   - Let the half-lengths of the rectangle along the x-axis and y-axis be \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively.\n\n3. **Equation of the Ellipse:**\n   - The constraint given by the ellipse is \\(\\frac{x^2}{5^2} + \\frac{y^2}{4^2} = 1\\).\n\n4. **Area of the Rectangle:**\n   - The area \\(A\\) of the rectangle is given by \\(A = 2x \\times 2y = 4xy\\).\n\n5. **Optimization Problem:**\n   - We need to maximize the area \\(A = 4xy\\) subject to the constraint \\(\\frac{x^2}{25} + \\frac{y^2}{16} = 1\\).\n\n6. **Use Lagrange Multipliers:**\n   - The method of Lagrange multipliers involves setting up the function \\(L(x, y, \\lambda) = 4xy + \\lambda \\left(1 - \\frac{x^2}{25} - \\frac{y^2}{16}\\right)\\).\n   - Take partial derivatives and set them to zero:\n     - \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 4y - \\lambda \\frac{2x}{25} = 0\\)\n     - \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = 4x - \\lambda \\frac{2y}{16} = 0\\)\n     - \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda} = 1 - \\frac{x^2}{25} - \\frac{y^2}{16} = 0\\)\n\n7. **Solve the System of Equations:**\n   - From \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0\\), we get \\(\\lambda = \\frac{100y}{x}\\).\n   - From \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = 0\\), we get \\(\\lambda = \\frac{64x}{y}\\).\n   - Equating the two expressions for \\(\\lambda\\), we have \\(\\frac{100y}{x} = \\frac{64x}{y}\\).\n   - Solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we get \\(x = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and \\(y = 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n8. **Calculate the Perimeter:**\n   - The full lengths of the rectangle are \\(2x = 5\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(2y = 4\\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - The perimeter \\(P\\) of the rectangle is \\(2(2x + 2y) = 2(5\\sqrt{2} + 4\\sqrt{2}) = 18\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n9. **Final Answer:**\n   - The length of the fencing material required is \\(18\\sqrt{2}\\) meters.\n\nAnswer: 18\u221a2"

            "To solve this problem, we need to consider two main parts: the properties of triangles and the permutations and combinations of possible side lengths.\n\n### Step 1: Verify the original triangle\nFirst, we need to verify that the given sides (9 cm, 40 cm, and 41 cm) can form a triangle. We use the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\n- Check: \\(9 + 40 > 41\\) (49 > 41, true)\n- Check: \\(9 + 41 > 40\\) (50 > 40, true)\n- Check: \\(40 + 41 > 9\\) (81 > 9, true)\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, the sides 9 cm, 40 cm, and 41 cm can indeed form a triangle.\n\n### Step 2: Consider possible errors in side lengths\nEach side can be either 1 cm too long or 1 cm too short. Therefore, for each side, there are two possibilities:\n\n- Side 1 (originally 9 cm): can be 8 cm or 10 cm\n- Side 2 (originally 40 cm): can be 39 cm or 41 cm\n- Side 3 (originally 41 cm): can be 40 cm or 42 cm\n\n### Step 3: Calculate all possible combinations\nEach side has 2 possibilities, so the total number of combinations is \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\\).\n\n### Step 4: Check which combinations form valid triangles\nWe need to check each combination to see if it satisfies the triangle inequality theorem and is not congruent to the original triangle.\n\n1. (8, 39, 40): Check triangle inequality\n   - \\(8 + 39 > 40\\) (47 > 40, true)\n   - \\(8 + 40 > 39\\) (48 > 39, true)\n   - \\(39 + 40 > 8\\) (79 > 8, true)\n   - Valid triangle\n\n2.

(10, 39, 40): Check triangle inequality\n   - \\(10 + 39 > 40\\) (49 > 40, true)\n   - \\(10 + 40 > 39\\) (50 > 39, true)\n   - \\(39 + 40 > 10\\) (79 > 10, true)\n   - Valid triangle\n\n6. (10, 39, 42): Check triangle inequality\n   - \\(10 + 39 > 42\\) (49 > 42, true)\n   - \\(10 + 42 > 39\\) (52 > 39, true)\n   - \\(39 + 42 > 10\\) (81 > 10, true)\n   - Valid triangle\n\n7. (10, 41, 40): Check triangle inequality\n   - \\(10 + 41 > 40\\) (51 > 40, true)\n   - \\(10 + 40 > 41\\) (50 > 41, true)\n   - \\(41 + 40 > 10\\) (81 > 10, true)\n   - Valid triangle\n\n8. (10, 41, 42): Check triangle inequality\n   - \\(10 + 41 > 42\\) (51 > 42, true)\n   - \\(10 + 42 > 41\\) (52 > 41, true)\n   - \\(41 + 42 > 10\\) (83 > 10, true)\n   - Valid triangle\n\n### Step 5: Exclude the original triangle\nThe original triangle is (9, 40, 41). We need to exclude this from our valid combinations.\n\n### Step 6: Count distinct triangles\nAll 8 combinations form valid triangles, and none are congruent to the original triangle. Therefore, all 8 are distinct and valid.\n\nAnswer: 8"

Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Helix Structure:**\n   - The helix wraps around the cylinder, making a full turn (360 degrees) for every 2 meters of vertical ascent.\n   - The radius of the cylinder is 1 meter.\n\n2. **Calculate the Circumference of the Cylinder:**\n   - The circumference of the base of the cylinder (which is a circle) is given by the formula \\( C = 2\\pi r \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius.\n   - Here, \\( r = 1 \\) meter, so the circumference \\( C = 2\\pi \\times 1 = 2\\pi \\) meters.\n\n3. **Determine the Length of One Helical Turn:**\n   - For each full turn of the helix, the cable ascends 2 meters vertically and wraps around the cylinder once.\n   - The length of one helical turn can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the vertical ascent, the circumference, and the helical path.\n   - The vertical ascent is 2 meters, and the horizontal distance (circumference) is \\( 2\\pi \\) meters.\n   - The length of one helical turn \\( L \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     L = \\sqrt{(2\\pi)^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{4\\pi^2 + 4}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Cable:**\n   - The total height of the cylinder is 10 meters.\n   - Since the helix ascends 2 meters per turn, the number of turns \\( n \\) is \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\) turns.\n   - The total length of the cable is \\( 5 \\times L \\).\n\n5. **Compute the Total Length:**\n   - First, calculate \\( L \\):\n     \\[\n     L = \\sqrt{4\\pi^2 + 4} = \\sqrt{4(\\pi^2 + 1)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     L = 2\\sqrt{\\pi^2 + 1}\n     \\]\n   - The total length of the cable is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Length} = 5 \\times 2\\sqrt{\\pi^2 + 1} = 10\\sqrt{\\pi^2 + 1}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Approximate and Round the Total Length:**\n   - Calculate \\( \\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\pi^2 + 1 \\approx 10.8696 \\).\n   - The square root is approximately \\( \\sqrt{10.8696} \\approx 3.296 \\).\n   - The total length is approximately \\( 10 \\times 3.296 = 32.96 \\).\n\n7. **Round to the Nearest Integer:**\n   - The total length of the cable, rounded to the nearest integer, is 33 meters.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the cable is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: 33}\n\\]"

So, \\(a_2 = 3\\).\n\n4. **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n   - The recurrence relation \\(a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\\) with initial conditions \\(a_1 = 2\\) and \\(a_2 = 3\\) is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but shifted.\n   - The solution to this recurrence is:\n     \\[\n     a_n = F_{n+2}\n     \\]\n   where \\(F_n\\) is the \\(n\\)-th Fibonacci number.\n\n5. **Calculate \\(p_n\\):**\n   - The total number of sequences of length \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\).\n   - Therefore, the probability \\(p_n\\) is:\n     \\[\n     p_n = \\frac{a_n}{2^n} = \\frac{F_{n+2}}{2^n}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Evaluate the Infinite Series:**\n   - We need to find:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+2}}{2^{2n}}\n     \\]\n\n   - Recognize that:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+2}}{4^n}\n     \\]\n   is a known generating function for the Fibonacci sequence:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} F_n x^n = \\frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}\n     \\]\n\n   - Substitute \\(x = \\frac{1}{4}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} F_n \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^n = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{11}{16}} = \\frac{4}{11}\n     \\]\n\n   - The series we need is:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+2}}{4^n} = \\frac{4}{11} - F_0 - \\frac{F_1}{4} = \\frac{4}{11} - 0 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4}{11} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{16}{44} - \\frac{11}{44} = \\frac{5}{44}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   - The value of the series is:\n     \\[\n     \\boxed{\\frac{5}{44}}\n     \\]"
