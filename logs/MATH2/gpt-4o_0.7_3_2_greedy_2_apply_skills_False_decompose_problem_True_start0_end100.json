After 7 minutes: Total = 5.6953125 + 0.5 * 5.6953125 = 8.54296875 liters.\n\nNotice that the amount of water is increasing towards a particular limit. The amount added each time is half of the existing amount, forming an infinite series. The limit of this series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, \\( S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} \\), where \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio. Here, \\( a = 0.5 \\) and \\( r = 0.5 \\).\n\nNow, calculate the limit approached:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{0.5}{1 - 0.5} = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of water approaches 1 liter. Since we are looking for the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the total amount of water never reaches or exceeds \\( n \\) liters, and since the amount approaches but never reaches 1 liter, the smallest integer \\( n \\) is 1.\n\nAnswer: 1",
                    "Continuing the calculation from the current step:\n\n5. After 5 minutes: Total = 2.53125 + 0.5 * 2.53125 = 3.796875 liters.\n6. After 6 minutes: Total = 3.796875 + 0.5 * 3.796875 = 5.6953125 liters.\n7. After 7 minutes: Total = 5.6953125 + 0.5 * 5.6953125 = 8.54296875 liters.\n8. After 8 minutes: Total = 8.54296875 + 0.5 * 8.54296875 = 12.814453125 liters.\n\nFrom this pattern, we can observe that the total amount of water in the container is approaching a limit. Specifically, the process of adding half of the current amount each minute forms a geometric series where the initial term \\( a = 0.5 \\) liters, and the common ratio \\( r = 1.5 \\).\n\nThe sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r} = \\frac{0.5}{1 - 0.5} = 1 \\text{ liter}\n\\]\n\nThe process described converges towards 1 liter, but never actually reaches it as time progresses indefinitely.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the total amount of water in the container is never in the interval \\([n, n+1]\\) is \\( n=1 \\).\n\nAnswer: 1"
