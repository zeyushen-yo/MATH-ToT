This involves solving the inequalities:\n\\[\n4 \\leq 2^{2x+2} + 2^{x+2} + 1 \\leq 49\n\\]\nFirst, we will solve the lower bound:\n\\[\n4 \\leq 2^{2x+2} + 2^{x+2} + 1\n\\]\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n3 \\leq 2^{2x+2} + 2^{x+2}\n\\]\n\nNext, we will also solve the upper bound:\n\\[\n2^{2x+2} + 2^{x+2} + 1 \\leq 49\n\\]\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n2^{2x+2} + 2^{x+2} \\leq 48\n\\]\n\nNow, I will proceed to solve these inequalities. \n\nStarting with the lower bound:\n1.

Now calculate \\( h = 28 - l - w \\):\n- For \\( (18, 3) \\): \\( h = 28 - 18 - 3 = 7 \\)\n- For \\( (10, 3) \\): \\( h = 28 - 10 - 3 = 15 \\)\n\nNow we found two sets of dimensions: \\( (18, 3, 7) \\) and \\( (10, 3, 15) \\). \n\nFinally, we calculate the volumes:\n1. Volume for \\( (18, 3, 7) \\):\n   \\[\n   V = 18 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 378\n   \\]\n   \n2. Volume for \\( (10, 3, 15) \\):\n   \\[\n   V = 10 \\times 3 \\times 15 = 450\n   \\]\n\nThus, the volumes of the rectangular prism are \\( 378 \\) and \\( 450 \\). \n\nTherefore, we will finalize our answer with the higher volume:\n\\[\n\\boxed{450}\n\\] \n\nAnswer: 450.",

After testing a few values, I will derive corresponding \\( l \\) values and compute \\( h \\) to find the volume \\( V = l \\cdot w \\cdot h \\). \n\nThis systematic approach will lead us to the integer pairs \\( (l, w) \\) that satisfy all the given conditions.",

The effective width that a tile occupies along both dimensions can be calculated using the formula for diagonal of a square:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Diagonal} = s\\sqrt{2} \\quad \\text{where } s = 1 \\, \\text{m}\n     \\]\n     Here, the diagonal is:\n     \\[\n     1 = s\\sqrt{2} \\Rightarrow s = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.707 \\, \\text{m}\n     \\]\n   - Thus, each tile effectively occupies approximately 0.707 meters along the width and length when placed at 45 degrees.\n\n2. **Determine how many tiles can fit along the length and width**:\n   - **Along the length (20 m)**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of tiles along length} = \\frac{20}{0.707} \\approx 28.28 \\quad \\text{(only full tiles count, so 28 tiles)}\n     \\]\n   - **Along the width (10 m)**:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of tiles along width} = \\frac{10}{0.707} \\approx 14.14 \\quad \\text{(only full tiles count, so 14 tiles)}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of tiles**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of tiles} = 28 \\times 14 = 392 \\text{ tiles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the area covered by tiles**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area covered by tiles} = 392 \\, \\text{m}^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the area of the field**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area of the field} = 200 \\, \\text{m}^2\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the area of un-tiled regions**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of un-tiled regions} = 200 \\, \\text{m}^2 - 392 \\, \\text{m}^2 = -192 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\quad \\text{(not possible)}\n   \\]\n\nSince the total number of tiles exceeds the area of the field, I will check for a maximum arrangement without exceeding the boundaries.\n\nAfter recalculating based on the constraints:\n\n- Maximum tiles along the effective width and length (considering the 45-degree arrangement) leads to the realization that overlap is not allowed. Thus, the tiling cannot cover the entire area.\n\nThe area of the rectangular field is 200 m\u00b2, and since we cannot cover it completely with the angled tiles, we need to find the minimum area of grassy regions remaining.\n\nAfter completing these calculations, I find:\n\nAnswer: \\( \\boxed{200 \\, \\text{m}^2} \\) is the area of grassy regions since no complete tiling is possible."

Conclusion\nCounting these valid numbers, we find that there are **40 three-digit positive integers** that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]",
                    "Possible next step: Now that we have identified the three-digit integers divisible by 5, the next step is to check which of these numbers leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4. \n\nI will perform this check for both groups of numbers: those ending in 0 and those ending in 5.\n\n### Checking Numbers Ending in 0:\n\n1. **100**: \\( 100 \\div 4 = 25 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\)

Numbers Ending with 0\nThere are no valid integers that satisfy both conditions among those ending with 0.\n\nThus, I will now move on to summarize findings for the final form, numbers ending with 5, and then count the total valid integers across all forms. \n\n### Total Valid Integers\nFrom the previous findings:\n- Valid integers ending with 5: **40**\n\nNo valid integers found ending with 0. \n\nTherefore, the total number of three-digit positive integers that are divisible by 5 and leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 remains **40**.\n\nAnswer: 40",

Using the formula for circumference \\(C = 2\\pi r\\), we can find:\n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi(1) = 2\\pi \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we will calculate the total horizontal distance traveled by the cable as it wraps around the cylinder for 5 turns. This can be done by multiplying the number of turns by the circumference:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total horizontal distance} = \\text{Number of turns} \\times \\text{Circumference} = 5 \\times 2\\pi\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the total horizontal distance and add it to the vertical distance to find the total length of the cable using the Pythagorean theorem. Let's proceed with these calculations. \n\nCalculating the total horizontal distance:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total horizontal distance} = 5 \\times 2\\pi = 10\\pi \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nNow we will set up the right triangle:\n\n- One leg of the triangle is the total vertical height of the cylinder (10 meters).\n- The other leg is the total horizontal distance (10\u03c0 meters).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the cable \\(L\\):\n\n\\[\nL = \\sqrt{(10\\pi)^2 + (10)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{100\\pi^2 + 100}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 10\\sqrt{\\pi^2 + 1}\n\\]\n\nNext, we will calculate this value using \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14\\):\n\n\\[\n\\pi^2 \\approx (3.14)^2 \\approx 9.8596\n\\]\n\\[\n\\pi^2 + 1 \\approx 9.8596 + 1 \\approx 10.8596\n\\]\nCalculating further,\n\n\\[\nL \\approx 10\\sqrt{10.8596} \\approx 10 \\times 3.296 \\approx 32.96\n\\]\n\nFinally, rounding to the nearest integer gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length of the cable} \\approx 33 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the cable is approximately **33 meters**.\n\nAnswer: 33"
