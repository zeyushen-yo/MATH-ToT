Let \\(r\\) be the radius of the pond.\n2. The radius of the larger circle (pond plus walkway) is \\(r + 2\\) meters.\n3. The area of the larger circle is \\(\\pi (r + 2)^2\\).\n4. The area of the pond is \\(\\pi r^2\\).\n5. The area of the walkway is \\(\\pi (r + 2)^2 - \\pi r^2\\).\n\nSet this equal to \\(29\\pi\\) and simplify:\n\n\\[\n\\pi (r + 2)^2 - \\pi r^2 = 29\\pi\n\\]\n\nDivide through by \\(\\pi\\):\n\n\\[\n(r + 2)^2 - r^2 = 29\n\\]\n\nNow, expand and simplify:\n\n\\[\n(r^2 + 4r + 4) - r^2 = 29\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n4r + 4 = 29\n\\]\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n4r = 25\n\\]\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThus, the first step is successfully calculating the radius of the pond to be 6.25 meters.",

            "Possible next step: Based on the observations from the simplified problem, we need to systematically explore all combinations of the identified prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, and 11) that sum to 11, ensuring that we use exactly three distinct boxes. Each combination should be checked to ensure that the sum of items in the boxes equals 11 and each box contains a prime number of items. We must also consider the distinct nature of the boxes, meaning different permutations of the same numbers across the boxes count as different distributions. Here is a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **List all combinations of three primes that sum to 11:** We will explore combinations of the identified primes. Since we need three boxes, one approach is to attempt to fill each box with a different prime number, ensuring the total sums to 11.\n\n2. **Systematically try and check the combinations:**\n\n   - **Combination 1:** (2, 2, 7)\n     - Box 1: 2 items (prime)\n     - Box 2: 2 items (prime)\n     - Box 3: 7 items (prime)\n     - Total: 2 + 2 + 7 = 11\n\n   - **Combination 2:** (2, 3, 6) - Invalid because 6 is not a prime.\n\n   - **Combination 3:** (2, 3, 5)\n     - Box 1: 2 items (prime)\n     - Box 2: 3 items (prime)\n     - Box 3: 5 items (prime)\n     - Total: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 (does not sum to 11)\n\n   - **Combination 4:** (2, 5, 4) - Invalid because 4 is not a prime.\n\n   - **Combination 5:** (3, 3, 5)\n     - Box 1: 3 items (prime)\n     - Box 2: 3 items (prime)\n     - Box 3: 5 items (prime)\n     - Total: 3 + 3 + 5 = 11\n\n   - **Combination 6:** (3, 5, 3) - Already considered in Combination 5 due to distinct box nature (same as (3, 3, 5)).\n\n   - **Other combinations:** Continue checking similar combinations systematically.\n\n3. **Count the valid combinations:** Based on the distinct nature of boxes, different permutations of the valid combinations (2, 2, 7) and (3, 3, 5) should be considered as separate distributions.\n\nTherefore, the valid combinations and their permutations are:\n- (2, 2, 7): 3 permutations (e.g., (2, 2, 7), (2, 7, 2), (7, 2, 2))\n- (3, 3, 5): 3 permutations (e.g., (3, 3, 5), (3, 5, 3), (5, 3, 3))\n\nAdding these permutations gives a total of 3 + 3 = 6 distinct ways to distribute 11 items into 3 boxes, where each box contains a prime number of items.\n\nAnswer: 6"
