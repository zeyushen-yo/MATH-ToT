This indicates that starting from any given position, after 9 passes, the ball will be at position 9, not position 0.\n\nSince there is no position that satisfies the condition to return to the starting position after exactly 9 passes, the probability is 0.\n\nThus, the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times is:\n\n\"Answer: 0\"",

Therefore, after 9 passes, the ball will be at position \\( (0 + 9) \\mod 10 = 9 \\).\n\nFor the ball to return to its original starting position (position 0), it must be at position 0 after 9 passes.
