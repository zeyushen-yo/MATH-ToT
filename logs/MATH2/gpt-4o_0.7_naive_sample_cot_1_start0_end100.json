The ball is passed a total of 9 times.\n\n2. **Determine the Movement**: Since there are 10 people in a circle, if the ball is passed 10 times, it would return to the starting person. However, the ball is only passed 9 times.\n\n3. **Identify the Final Position**: When the ball is passed 9 times, it will end up with the person who is 9 positions to the right of the starting person. \n\n4. **Circle Dynamics**: In a circular arrangement of 10 people, moving 9 positions to the right is equivalent to moving 1 position to the left. This is because moving 10 positions to the right would bring you back to the original position.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, after 9 passes, the ball will be with the person who is immediately to the left of the starting position. This means the ball does not return to the starting person after 9 passes.\n\n6. **Calculate Probability**: Since the ball cannot be with the starting person after 9 passes, the probability is 0.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times is:\n\n\"Answer: 0\"",
