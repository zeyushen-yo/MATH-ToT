                    "Possible next step: **Determine the different color sequences for 6 consecutive beads based on the outlined bead group pattern.**\n\n### **Identifying Possible 6-Bead Sequences**\n\nGiven the bead group pattern:\n\n- **Group 1:** 2 red beads (R, R)\n- **Group 2:** 4 blue beads (B, B, B, B)\n- **Group 3:** 8 green beads (G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G)\n- **Group 4:** 16 red beads (R \u00d716)\n- **Group 5:** 32 blue beads (B \u00d732)\n- **Group 6:** 64 green beads (G \u00d764)\n- **...** and so on.\n\nA bracelet consists of **6 consecutive beads**, which can either be entirely within a single group or span across two adjacent groups. Let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n#### **Case 1: All 6 Beads Within a Single Group**\n\n- **Group 1 (Red):** Contains only 2 beads. *Cannot* accommodate 6 beads.\n- **Group 2 (Blue):** Contains 4 beads. *Cannot* accommodate 6 beads.\n- **Group 3 (Green):** Contains 8 beads. *Can* accommodate 6 green beads.\n- **Group 4 (Red):** Contains 16 beads. *Can* accommodate 6 red beads.\n- **Group 5 (Blue):** Contains 32 beads. *Can* accommodate 6 blue beads.\n- **Group 6 (Green):** Contains 64 beads. *Can* accommodate 6 green beads.\n- **...** and so on for subsequent groups.\n\n**Possible Single-Color Bracelets:**\n- **6 Red Beads (R, R, R, R, R, R)**\n- **6 Blue Beads (B, B, B, B, B, B)**\n- **6 Green Beads (G, G, G, G, G, G)**\n\n#### **Case 2: Spanning Two Adjacent Groups**\n\nSince the first two groups cannot individually accommodate 6 beads, sequences spanning two groups are essential. We'll analyze the possible combinations:\n\n1. **Red and Blue:**\n   - **Scenario:** Part of a red group followed by part of a blue group.\n   - **Possible Combinations:**\n     - 2 Red + 4 Blue (R, R, B, B, B, B)\n   \n2. **Blue and Green:**\n   - **Scenario:** Part of a blue group followed by part of a green group.\n   - **Possible Combinations:**\n     - 4 Blue + 2 Green (B, B, B, B, G, G)\n\n3. **Green and Red:**\n   - **Scenario:** Part of a green group followed by part of a red group.\n   - **Possible Combinations:**\n     - 6 Green (already covered in Case 1)\n     - 5 Green + 1 Red (G, G, G, G, G, R)\n     - 4 Green + 2 Red (G, G, G, G, R, R)\n     - 3 Green + 3 Red (G, G, G, R, R, R)\n     - 2 Green + 4 Red (G, G, R, R, R, R)\n     - 1 Green + 5 Red (G, R, R, R, R, R)\n\n**Summary of Two-Color Combinations:**\n- **Red and Blue:**\n  - 2R + 4B\n- **Blue and Green:**\n  - 4B + 2G\n- **Green and Red:**\n  - 1G + 5R\n  - 2G + 4R\n  - 3G + 3R\n  - 4G + 2R\n  - 5G + 1R\n\n#### **Case 3: Spanning Three Groups**\n\nGiven the exponential growth of bead group sizes (doubling each time), spanning three groups for just 6 beads is unnecessary as even the smallest combination (e.g., 2R + 4B + 0G) falls under the two-group scenario. Therefore, **three-group spans do not yield new unique sequences** beyond what's already covered.\n\n### **Summary of Possible Bracelet Color Sequences**\n\n1. **Single-Color Bracelets:**\n   - 6R\n   - 6B\n   - 6G\n\n2. **Two-Color Mixtures:**\n   - **Red and Blue:**\n     - 2R + 4B\n   - **Blue and Green:**\n     - 4B + 2G\n   - **Green and Red:**\n     - 1G + 5R\n     - 2G + 4R\n     - 3G + 3R\n     - 4G + 2R\n     - 5G + 1R\n\n### **Conclusion of This Step**\n\nBy categorizing the possible 6-bead sequences into single-color and two-color mixtures based on how they fit within or span across bead groups, we've identified all potential color patterns for the bracelets."

                    "### **Applying the Shoelace Formula to Calculate the Overlapping Area**\n\nTo determine the overlapping area between the original square and its rotated version, we'll use the **Shoelace Formula**. This formula is effective for finding the area of a simple polygon when the coordinates of its vertices are known.\n\n#### **1. Identifying the Coordinates of the Overlapping Region**\n\nAfter rotating the square by \\( 45^\\circ \\) around one of its vertices, the overlapping region between the original and rotated squares is a polygon whose vertices can be determined by the intersection points of the two squares. \n\nAssuming the original square has vertices at:\n- \\( A = (0, 0) \\)\n- \\( B = (N, 0) \\)\n- \\( C = (N, N) \\)\n- \\( D = (0, N) \\)\n\nUpon rotating the square \\( 45^\\circ \\) around vertex \\( A \\), the new vertices become:\n- \\( A' = (0, 0) \\) (unchanged)\n- \\( B' = \\left(\\frac{N}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{N}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\)\n- \\( C' = \\left(0, N\\sqrt{2}\\right) \\)\n- \\( D' = \\left(-\\frac{N}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{N}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\)\n\nThe overlapping region is typically a polygon with six vertices. For simplicity, let's assume the vertices of the overlapping region are ordered as follows:\n1. \\( A = (0, 0) \\)\n2. \\( P = \\left(\\frac{N}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{N}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\)\n3. \\( Q = \\left(\\frac{N}{\\sqrt{2}}, N\\right) \\)\n4. \\( C = (N, N) \\)\n5. \\( B = (N, 0) \\)\n6. \\( D = (0, N) \\)\n\n**Note:** The exact coordinates may vary based on the specific intersections, but for the purpose of applying the Shoelace Formula, we'll proceed with these assumed points.\n\n#### **2. Listing the Coordinates in Order**\n\nLet's list the coordinates in a clockwise order to apply the Shoelace Formula:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& (0, 0) \\quad & A \\\\\n& \\left(\\frac{N}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{N}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\quad & P \\\\\n& \\left(\\frac{N}{\\sqrt{2}}, N\\right) \\quad & Q \\\\\n& (N, N) \\quad & C \\\\\n& (N, 0) \\quad & B \\\\\n& (0, N) \\quad & D \\\\\n& (0, 0) \\quad & \\text{(Closing the polygon)}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n#### **3.

Once we have these coordinates, we'll apply the Shoelace Formula to calculate the area of the overlapping region in terms of \\( N \\).\n\n#### 1. **Original Square \\( S \\)**\n- **Positioning:**\n  - Let's place the original square \\( S \\) on the coordinate plane with one vertex at the origin \\((0, 0)\\) and its sides aligned with the axes.\n  \n- **Vertices of \\( S \\):**\n  - \\( A = (0, 0) \\) (Origin)\n  - \\( B = (N, 0) \\)\n  - \\( C = (N, N) \\)\n  - \\( D = (0, N) \\)\n\n#### 2. **Rotated Square \\( S' \\)**\n- **Rotation Details:**\n  - Square \\( S \\) is rotated \\( 45^\\circ \\) about the origin.\n  - The rotation matrix for a \\( 45^\\circ \\) rotation is:\n    \\[\n    R = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\cos(45^\\circ) & -\\sin(45^\\circ) \\\\\n    \\sin(45^\\circ) & \\cos(45^\\circ) \\\\\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\\\\n    \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\\\\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n  \n- **Rotated Vertices of \\( S' \\):**\n  -

The overlapping region is the intersection of the original square \\( S \\) and the rotated square \\( S' \\).\n  - To find the overlapping region's vertices, we need to identify the intersection points of the edges of \\( S \\) and \\( S' \\).\n  \n- **Edges of Original Square \\( S \\):**\n  1. **Edge \\( AB \\):** From \\( (0, 0) \\) to \\( (N, 0) \\)\n  2. **Edge \\( BC \\):** From \\( (N, 0) \\) to \\( (N, N) \\)\n  3. **Edge \\( CD \\):** From \\( (N, N) \\) to \\( (0, N) \\)\n  4. **Edge \\( DA \\):** From \\( (0, N) \\) to \\( (0, 0) \\)\n\n- **Edges of Rotated Square \\( S' \\):**\n  1. **Edge \\( A'B' \\):** From \\( (0, 0) \\) to \\( \\left( \\frac{N\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{N\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) \\)\n  2. **Edge \\( B'C' \\):** From \\( \\left( \\frac{N\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{N\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) \\) to \\( (0, N\\sqrt{2}) \\)\n  3. **Edge \\( C'D' \\):** From \\( (0, N\\sqrt{2}) \\) to \\( \\left( -\\frac{N\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{N\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) \\)\n  4. **Edge \\( D'A' \\):** From \\( \\left( -\\frac{N\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{N\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) \\) to \\( (0, 0) \\)\n\n- **Finding Intersection Points:**\n  -
