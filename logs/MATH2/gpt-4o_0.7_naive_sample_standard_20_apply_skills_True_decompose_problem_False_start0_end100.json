            "To solve this problem, let's first understand the situation. There are 10 friends sitting in a circle, and they pass a ball to the person on their right.

Let's say the game starts with the ball at person 0. After one pass to the right, the ball moves to person 1, after two passes it moves to person 2, and so on. \n\nSince there are 10 people, the ball's position after \\( n \\) passes is given by \\( n \\mod 10 \\). \n\nFor the ball to return to the starting person (person 0) after 9 passes, we need:\n\n\\[ 9 \\mod 10 = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, \\( 9 \\mod 10 = 9 \\), not 0.

The only time the ball returns to the starting position is when the number of passes is a multiple of the total number of people, which is 10.\n\nAs the number of passes (9) does not satisfy this condition, the probability of the ball returning to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times is:\n\nAnswer: 0",
            "In this problem, we have a group of 10 friends sitting in a circle. The ball is passed to the right 9 times, and we are asked to find the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after these 9 passes.\n\nSince the friends are sitting in a circle, passing the ball 10 times would return it to the original person, as it would complete a full circle. Therefore, for the ball to return to the starting person after 9 passes, it would need to have completed exactly 9 passes around the circle, which is not possible with only 9 passes. Instead, it would need to complete a full cycle (10 passes) minus 1.\n\nIn this setup, the ball will be at the position that is 1 place to the left of the starting position after 9 passes (since 10 friends are in a circle, and passing to the right 9 times will leave the ball 1 position to the left of the starting position).\n\nThus, the probability of the ball returning to the starting person after 9 passes is 0, because it is impossible to complete a full loop and return to the starting point with only 9 passes.\n\nAnswer: 0",

After one complete round of passing the ball 9 times, the ball will have moved 9 positions to the right.\n\nSince the circle consists of 10 people, moving 9 positions to the right is equivalent to moving 1 position to the left, because 9 mod 10 equals 9, which is 1 less than a full circle (10 positions). Thus, after 9 passes, the ball will end up one position to the left of where it started.\n\nTherefore, the ball will not be back with the starting person unless it is passed a total of 10 times (or any multiple of 10 times).\n\nHence, the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times is 0.\n\nAnswer: 0",

We want this position to be the same as the starting position.\n\nIn a circle of 10 people, if you move 10 positions from any starting point, you end up back at the starting point (since 10 is a multiple of the total number of people). Therefore, for the ball to return to the starting person after 9 passes, the number of positions passed (9) must be congruent to 0 modulo 10.\n\nHowever, since 9 is not congruent to 0 modulo 10, but rather congruent to 9 modulo 10, this means that after 9 passes, the ball will end up at the position 1 step to the left of the starting position (since 10 - 9 = 1).\n\nThus, it is impossible for the ball to return to the starting person after exactly 9 passes because the number of passes (9) does not complete a full circle (10).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the ball returns to the starting person after being passed exactly 9 times is 0.\n\nAnswer: 0",

The ball is passed to the right, meaning it moves to the next number in the sequence. After 10 passes, the ball would naturally return to the starting person because 10 is the number of people, completing a full cycle.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that the ball is passed exactly 9 times. We need to find out if, after 9 passes, the ball can return to the starting position.\n\n1. **Calculate the position after 9 passes:**\n   - Starting from position 0 (the initial person), each pass adds 1 to the position (modulo 10 because there are 10 positions, and after position 9 it loops back to position 0).\n   - After 9 passes, the position is calculated as \\( (0 + 9) \\mod 10 = 9 \\).\n\n2.
