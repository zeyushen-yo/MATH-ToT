We will calculate the possible starting positions for a 6-bead sequence within each section, considering the transition between sections as well:\n\n1. **Red (1st section):** \n   - Beads 1 to 2: No sequence of 6 beads can start here because there aren't enough beads to reach 6.\n\n2. **Blue (1st section):** \n   - Beads 3 to 6: A sequence can start at beads 3 or 4, but not beyond because 6 beads will extend into the green section.\n\n3. **Green (1st section):** \n   - Beads 7 to 14: A sequence can start at beads 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11. Starting at 12 or beyond would not complete a full sequence of 6 beads within the green section.\n\n4. **Red (2nd section):** \n   - Beads 15 to 30: A sequence can start at beads 15 to 25. Starting at 26 or beyond would not complete 6 beads within the red section.\n\nGiven these starting positions, the total number of unique sequences is the sum of possible starting positions in each section:\n\n- Blue (1st section): 2 starting positions (3, 4)\n- Green (1st section): 5 starting positions (7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n- Red (2nd section): 11 starting positions (15 to 25)\n\nTotal unique sequences = 2 + 5 + 11 = 18\n\nNow, to ensure a bracelet is formed with an integer perimeter, note that each bead contributes 0.5 units in length, thus 6 beads contribute 3 units.

                    "Possible next step: Now that we have established the layout of the colored sections and their indices, the next step is to explicitly calculate the number of unique sequences of 6 consecutive beads by analyzing how these sequences overlap within and across the boundaries of the colored sections.\n\n1. For sequences starting within the first red section (beads 1 to 2):\n   - Only 1 sequence is possible: starting at bead 1 and ending at bead 6 (1 red, 4 blue, 1 green).\n\n2. For sequences starting within the first blue section (beads 3 to 6):\n   - Starting at bead 3: 4 sequences are possible (3 red, 3 blue).\n   - Each sequence from bead 3 to bead 6 fully resides within the blue section.\n\n3.

For sequences starting within the second red section (beads 15 to 30):\n   - Calculate similarly: Start by figuring out the sequences that overlap from green to red, and then those that are completely within the red section.\n\nFinally, after determining all possible starting points and their respective sequences, sum them to find the total number of different sequences.\n\nThis process allows us to explicitly count each valid sequence of 6 beads, ensuring that all boundary conditions are accounted for.",

This means the sequence of sections is: R, R, B, B, B, B, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, and then the second red section starts with 16 beads.\n\nStart by enumerating sequences beginning at each bead from the initial red section onwards, ensuring to account for transitions between different colored sections.

Starting at the first B bead: Sequence could be (B, B, B, B, G, G).\n\nContinue this process for each possible starting position until you have covered all potential sequences. Be careful to check and eliminate any sequences that are rotationally equivalent to others already considered.\n\nMake sure to calculate the integer perimeter condition for each unique sequence by multiplying the length of each bead (0.5 units) by 6, and check if the total perimeter is an integer (e.g., 3 units, 6 units, etc.).",

Let \\(s = 3k\\) for some integer \\(k\\), then:\n\n\\[ s^2 = (3k)^2 = 9k^2 \\]\n\nWe also have that \\(s^2 = 6n\\).

                    "Possible next step: Begin by calculating the total number of patches in the garden and then categorize each patch based on its position (interior, edge, or corner). Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of patches:**\n   - The garden is 63 x 49 feet, divided into 7x7 feet patches, resulting in a grid of (63/7) x (49/7) = 9 x 7 patches.\n\n2. **Identify the type of each patch:**\n   - **Corner patches:** There are 4 corners in the grid.\n   - **Edge patches (excluding corners):** \n     - Top and bottom rows each have (7 - 2) = 5 edge patches (excluding corners).\n     - Left and right columns each have (9 - 2) = 7 edge patches (excluding corners).\n     - Total unique edge patches (excluding double-counted corners) = 5 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 24.\n   - **Interior patches:** Total patches - corner patches - edge patches = 63 - 4 - 24 = 35.\n\n3. **Calculate valid mint patches for each rose patch:**\n   - **Corner patch:** 3 invalid neighbor patches, leaving 63 - 3 = 60 valid mint patches.\n   - **Edge patch:** 5 invalid neighbor patches, leaving 63 - 5 = 58 valid mint patches.\n   - **Interior patch:** 8 invalid neighbor patches, leaving 63 - 8 = 55 valid mint patches.\n\n4. **Sum the valid configurations:**\n   - For corner patches: 4 patches * 60 valid choices each = 240 configurations.\n   - For edge patches: 24 patches * 58 valid choices each = 1,392 configurations.\n   - For interior patches: 35 patches * 55 valid choices each = 1,925 configurations.\n\n5. **Total configurations:**\n   - Total = 240 + 1,392 + 1,925 = 3,557.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to plant roses and mint such that they thrive is:\n\nAnswer: 3,557",
                    "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of ways to select patches for roses and mint such that they do not touch each other.

Thus, for a rose patch at an interior position, there are \\( 63 - 9 = 54 \\) valid mint patches.\n   - **Edge patches (not corners)**: These have 5 neighboring patches. There are 24 such patches (2 patches on each of the four edges, excluding corners).
