Therefore, the area of the walkway is the difference between these two areas: \\(\\pi (r + 2)^2 - \\pi r^2\\).\n\nCalculate this expression:\n\n\\[\n\\pi (r + 2)^2 - \\pi r^2 = \\pi ((r + 2)^2 - r^2) = \\pi (r^2 + 4r + 4 - r^2) = \\pi (4r + 4) = 4\\pi (r + 1)\n\\]\n\nNow, set this equal to the given area of the walkway, which is the 10th prime number times \\(\\pi\\). The 10th prime number is 29, so:\n\n\\[\n4\\pi (r + 1) = 29\\pi\n\\]\n\nYou can then solve this equation for \\( r \\) by dividing both sides by \\( 4\\pi \\):\n\n\\[\nr + 1 = \\frac{29}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, \n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{29}{4} - 1 = \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThe radius of the pond is 6.25 meters."

For the perimeter of the bracelet to be an integer, this length must be a whole number. Since 3 is already an integer, the bracelet length does not need further adjustment. Therefore, the first concrete step is to identify the combination of 6 consecutive beads from the series that results in a bracelet with a perimeter of exactly 3 units, given our understanding that each bracelet made in this manner will already satisfy the integer constraint. \n\nNext, analyze the sequence from the infinite series to find different sets of 6 consecutive beads, keeping the color pattern and bead counts in mind.

Let's break down the sequence generation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Red sections have beads in numbers: 2, 16, 64, etc. (powers of 2 starting from 2^1).\n   - Blue sections have beads in numbers: 4, 32, 128, etc. (powers of 2 starting from 2^2).\n   - Green sections have beads in numbers: 8, 64, 256, etc. (powers of 2 starting from 2^3).\n\n2. **Generate Initial Sequences:**\n   - Start by creating sequences from the initial sections where the first red section has 2 beads, the first blue section has 4 beads, and the first green section has 8 beads.\n\n3. **Systematic Sequence Generation:**\n   - **Red Section Start:**\n     - [R, R, B, B, B, B]\n     - [R, B, B, B, B, G]\n     - [B, B, B, B, G, G]\n     - [B, B, B, G, G, G]\n     - [B, B, G, G, G, G]\n\n   - **Blue Section Start:**\n     - [B, G, G, G, G, R] (Transition to next red section with 16 beads)\n     - [G, G, G, G, R, R]\n     - [G, G, G, R, R, R]\n     - [G, G, R, R, R, R]\n     - [G, R, R, R, R, R]\n\n4. **Continue with Next Sections:**\n   - You will need to continue this sequence generation as the pattern progresses, ensuring that each sequence transitions correctly between sections.\n\n5. **Counting Distinct Sequences:**\n   - Given that each sequence is 6 beads long, and each bead is 0.5 units, the perimeter of each bracelet is 3 units, which satisfies the integer condition. Therefore, we only need to count the number of distinct sequences.\n\n6. **Calculate Total Number of Sequences:**\n   - To determine the total number of sequences, we systematically list all possible sequences following the pattern, as shown above.\n\nSince each generated sequence automatically satisfies the integer perimeter condition, the next step is to continue generating and counting the sequences until all possible sequences of length 6 are identified.\n\nAnswer: 10 distinct sequences.\n\nThus, there are 10 different bracelets that can be made under the given conditions.",

Since each bead is 0.5 units, any sequence of 6 beads will have a perimeter of 3 units, which is an integer. Therefore, every sequence of 6 beads can form a valid bracelet.\n\nLet's systematically generate all possible sequences of 6 beads:\n\n1. Start from the first red section:\n   - [R, R, B, B, B, B]\n   - [R, B, B, B, B, G]\n   - [B, B, B, B, G, G]\n   - [B, B, B, G, G, G]\n   - [B, B, G, G, G, G]\n   - [B, G, G, G, G, G]\n   - [G, G, G, G, G, G]\n\n2.

Since every sequence of 6 beads satisfies the perimeter condition, count all the distinct sequences you have identified.\n\nAnswer: 14 distinct sequences can be formed following this pattern."

This requires solving for \\( n \\) such that:\n\n\\[ 1 - (0.5)^{n+1} \\leq n \\text{ or } 1 - (0.5)^{n+1} \\geq n+1. \\]\n\nNext, solve these inequalities to find the smallest \\( n \\).",

Consider the garden as a grid with coordinates for each patch (ranging from (1,1) to (9,7)).\n2. Select a patch for roses and then determine the valid positions for mint that do not touch the selected rose patch. \n3.

Consider each patch as a potential position for the rose patch. For each possible rose patch, calculate the number of mint patches that do not touch the rose patch. \n\n2. Two patches are considered touching if they are adjacent either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This means for a given rose patch, we need to exclude the patches that are directly adjacent or diagonal to it.\n\n3. For a grid of 9x7 patches:\n   - If a rose patch is not on an edge or corner, it will have up to 8 surrounding patches that must be excluded (1 above, 1 below, 1 left, 1 right, and 4 diagonals).\n   - If a rose patch is on an edge but not a corner, it will have fewer than 8 surrounding patches (5 or 3 depending on the specific edge).\n   - If a rose patch is on a corner, it will have 3 surrounding patches.\n\n4.

                    "Possible next step: Now that we know there are 63 square patches, we need to determine how many ways we can choose two patches for planting roses and mint such that they do not touch each other. \n\nTo do this, visualize the garden as a grid of 9 rows and 7 columns. We want to select two squares that are not adjacent either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. \n\nOne approach is to calculate the total number of ways to choose two patches and subtract the cases where the patches are touching. \n\n1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose any two patches out of 63. This is given by the combination formula C(n, k), where n is the total number of patches, and k is the number of patches we are choosing. Here, C(63, 2) = 63! / (2! * (63-2)!) = 63 * 62 / 2 = 1953 ways.\n\n2. Calculate the number of ways to choose two adjacent patches. Consider each of the following scenarios:\n   - Horizontal adjacency: For each row of 9 patches, there are 8 possible horizontal adjacent pairs (since choosing any patch except the last one in a row can pair with the next). With 7 rows, there are 8 * 7 = 56 horizontal adjacent pairs.\n   - Vertical adjacency: Similarly, for each column of 7 patches, there are 6 possible vertical adjacent pairs. With 9 columns, there are 6 * 9 = 54 vertical adjacent pairs.\n   - Diagonal adjacency: Consider both left-diagonal and right-diagonal pairs. For a 9x7 grid, you can identify diagonal pairs similarly but more carefully, noting that diagonal pairs can occur in both directions. A rough estimate is that each grid creates a similar number of diagonal adjacency as horizontal and vertical pairs, so we can assume a similar count.\n\n3. Subtract the number of adjacent cases from the total number of ways to ensure roses and mint are not adjacent.\n\nBy calculating these, you will arrive at the number of configurations where the rose and mint patches are not touching each other.",

With 7 rows, this gives 7 x 8 = 56 side-by-side horizontal pairs.\n   - Vertically: For each column of 7 patches, there are 6 vertical pairs.

Visualize the garden grid as a checkerboard with alternating colors (black and white). For example:\n   - The patches in the 1st row would be colored as: Black, White, Black, White, ..., alternating for each patch.\n   - The 2nd row would start with White, Black, White, Black, ..., and so on.\n\n2. Determine the number of black patches and the number of white patches:\n   - Since the grid is 9 x 7, it contains an odd number of rows and columns.\n   - In a checkerboard pattern, one color will have more patches than the other. In this case, there will be more black patches because the first patch in the first row is black.\n\n3. Count the number of black and white patches:\n   - Total patches = 63\n   - Black patches = (9 * 4) + 5 = 41 (since there are 5 black patches in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th rows, and 4 in the even rows)\n   - White patches = 63 - 41 = 22\n\n4.

Verify that 221 is the smallest such product:\n\n   - Check products of other possible combinations of larger primes (e.g., \\(11 \\times 19\\), \\(13 \\times 19\\), etc.) and confirm they all yield products larger than 221.\n\n4.

                    "Your current step provides an incorrect conclusion. The answer is not \"Infinitely many choices.\" Let's solve the problem to find the correct answer.\n\nGiven:\n- The roots are two consecutive positive integers.\n- The product of the roots is 56.\n\nLet the roots be \\( r \\) and \\( r+1 \\). The product of the roots \\( r(r+1) = 56 \\).\n\nSolve for \\( r \\):\n\\[\nr^2 + r - 56 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) with \\( a = 1, b = 1, c = -56 \\), we find:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 224}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{225}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-1 \\pm 15}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad r = \\frac{-16}{2} = -8\n\\]\n\nSince \\( r \\) must be positive, \\( r = 7 \\).

                    "The current step already contains an answer, but it is incorrect. Let's verify the solution correctly.\n\nWe know the roots of the quadratic equation are two consecutive positive integers, say \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\). The product of the roots is given by:\n\n\\[\nn(n + 1) = 56\n\\]\n\nSolving this, we have:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + n - 56 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -56 \\):\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-56)}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 224}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{225}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm 15}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = \\frac{-16}{2} = -8\n\\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be a positive integer, we have \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( n+1 = 8 \\).\n\nSo the roots are 7 and 8.

                    "Your current step contains an incorrect answer. Let's solve the problem to find the correct answer.\n\nGiven that the roots are two consecutive positive integers and their product is 56, we can denote the roots as \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nn(n+1) = 56\n\\]\n\nSolving this equation:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + n - 56 = 0\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( n \\), we factor the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + n - 56 = (n - 7)(n + 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the solutions are \\( n = 7 \\) or \\( n = -8 \\). Since we are looking for positive integers, we choose \\( n = 7 \\). Therefore, the roots are 7 and 8.\n\nThe quadratic equation with these roots is:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - (7+8)x + 7 \\times 8 = 0\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 15x + 56 = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -15 \\), and \\( c = 56 \\).

                    "To solve the problem, we need to systematically calculate the products of combinations of three distinct two-digit prime numbers and check the remainder when divided by 5. The goal is to find the smallest such product that gives a remainder of 2.\n\nWe have the list of two-digit prime numbers: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.\n\nPossible next step:\n1.

For each product, calculate the remainder when divided by 5, i.e., compute \\(P \\mod 5\\).\n3. Record the product if it leaves a remainder of 2.\n4. Track the smallest product found that meets this condition.\n\nFor example, let's start with the smallest three primes from the list: 11, 13, and 17.\n\n- Calculate the product: \\(11 \\times 13 \\times 17 = 2431\\).\n- Check the remainder: \\(2431 \\mod 5 = 1\\).\n\nSince \\(2431 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\\), it does not satisfy the condition.

The product of all solutions is $32^{32/32} = 32$. Thus, the ratio of the sum of all solutions to the product of all solutions is $0 / 32 = 0$. Therefore, the real part of this ratio is 0.",

The next step is to express 32 in exponential form to find all complex solutions.

This will help us determine the minimum area of the grassy region.\n\n1. **Understanding the Tile Orientation:**\n   - Each tile, when rotated by 45 degrees, forms a diamond with a diagonal of 1 meter (since it is a 1-meter square rotated).\n   - The effective coverage of a tile in a straight line (either horizontally or vertically) is \\(\\sqrt{2}/2\\) meters per side, but since we are interested in fitting them along the diagonal of the field, the diagonal of 1 meter is the key dimension.\n\n2. **Calculating the Number of Tiles that Fit Along the Width:**\n   - The width of the field is 10 meters.\n   - Since each diamond tile\u2019s diagonal is 1 meter, you can fit 10 tiles along the width.\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Tiles that Fit Along the Length:**\n   - The length of the field is 20 meters.\n   - Similarly, you can fit 20 tiles along the length.\n\n4. **Total Number of Tiles:**\n   - Multiply the number of tiles along the width by the number of tiles along the length to find the total number of tiles that can fit without overlapping: \\(10 \\times 20 = 200\\) tiles.\n\n5. **Determining the Grassy Area:**\n   - The field area is 200 square meters.\n   - Since 200 one square meter tiles perfectly cover the field, there will be no untiled area.\n\nBased on the above steps, the entire field can be perfectly tiled with the 1 square meter diamond-shaped tiles when rotated by 45 degrees, without any overlap or need for cutting.\n\nAnswer: 0 square meters.",
                    "Possible next step: Determine how many 1-meter diagonal tiles can fit along the width and length of the field, given that the tiles are rotated 45 degrees.\n\n1. **Calculate the effective width and length of the field:** When the tiles are rotated by 45 degrees, the effective horizontal and vertical spacing between the tiles' centers becomes larger than 1 meter. Each tile covers a distance of \\( \\sqrt{2}/2 \\) meters along both the width and length of the field.\n\n2. **Determine the number of tiles along the width (10 meters):** Since each tile has an effective width of \\( \\sqrt{2}/2 \\) meters, calculate how many tiles fit along the width:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of tiles along width} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}/2} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}{1} \\right\\rfloor\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of tiles along the length (20 meters):** Similarly, calculate how many tiles fit along the length:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of tiles along length} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{2}/2} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}{1} \\right\\rfloor\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of tiles:** Multiply the number of tiles that fit along the width by the number that fit along the length to find the total number of tiles that can cover the field.\n\n5. **Determine the grassy area:** Subtract the total area covered by these tiles from the total area of the field to find the grassy area.\n\nOnce these calculations are performed, we'll have the minimum area of the grassy regions.",
                    "To solve the problem of determining how many 1 square meter tiles, rotated by 45 degrees, can fit within the 10 by 20 meters field, we need to understand how these tiles will fit when oriented diagonally. Each tile, when rotated, forms a diamond shape with its diagonals aligned with the field's edges.\n\nGiven:\n- Each 1 square meter tile, when rotated by 45 degrees, forms a diamond with a diagonal length of 1 meter.\n- The width of the field is 10 meters and the length is 20 meters.\n\nTo find the number of tiles that fit:\n1. **Calculate the number of tiles along the width:**\n   - Since the diagonal of each tile is 1 meter, and this diagonal is aligned with the field's width, the number of tiles fitting along the width is simply the width of the field (10 meters) divided by the diagonal length of each tile (1 meter).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of tiles along the width} = \\frac{10 \\text{ meters}}{1 \\text{ meter}} = 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of tiles along the length:**\n   - Similarly, the number of tiles fitting along the length is the length of the field (20 meters) divided by the diagonal length of each tile (1 meter).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of tiles along the length} = \\frac{20 \\text{ meters}}{1 \\text{ meter}} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of tiles that can fit:**\n   - Multiply the number of tiles along the width by the number of tiles along the length to find the total number of tiles that fit in the field.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of tiles} = 10 \\times 20 = 200\n   \\]\n\nSince the total area of the field is 200 square meters, and we can fit exactly 200 tiles, there will be no un-tiled area in the field.\n\nAnswer: 0 square meters of grassy regions."

The middle point of the longer side of each rectangle is tangent to the circle. Since the radius of the circle is 10 feet, the point of tangency will also be 10 feet away from the center of the circle. The longer side of the rectangle is \\(20\\sqrt{3}\\) feet, so half of it is \\(10\\sqrt{3}\\) feet. \n\nThe distance from the center of the garden to the midpoint of the longer side (which is also the tangent point) is the radius, 10 feet. The half-length of the longer side forms a right triangle with one vertex at the center of the circle. The angle subtended by the half-length of the longer side at the center can be found using the tangent function:\n\n\\[\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{half-length of longer side}}{\\text{radius}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{10} = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(\\sqrt{3}) = 60^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThus, the angle subtended by the entire longer side of the rectangle is \\(2 \\times 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ\\).\n\nWith this angle, we can determine how many such rectangles can fit around the circle by dividing the full circle angle by the angle subtended by one rectangle:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{120^\\circ} = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum number of such rectangular flower beds that can be placed around the garden is 3.",

The middle point of the longer side is tangent to the circular garden with radius 10 feet. Since the middle of the longer side is tangent, the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the line containing the longer side is 10 feet.\n\nNow, consider the rectangle's longer side as a chord of a circle of radius \\(10 + 10 = 20\\) feet (since the rectangle's middle point is tangent, the rectangle is effectively outside the circle with its midpoint at the tangent point).\n\nUsing the right triangle formed with half of the longer side (\\(10\\sqrt{3}\\) feet), the radius of the circle (20 feet), and the perpendicular from the center of the circle to the chord (10 feet):\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\text{adjacent side}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{10}{20} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(\\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 60^\\circ\\).\n\nSince each rectangle subtends an angle of \\(60^\\circ\\) at the center, you can calculate how many such rectangles fit around the \\(360^\\circ\\) of the circle by dividing \\(360^\\circ\\) by \\(60^\\circ\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{60^\\circ} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum number of such rectangular flower beds that can be placed around the garden is 6.",

The longer side, \\(20\\sqrt{3}\\) feet, is tangent to the circle at its midpoint. The distance from the center of the circle (O) to the midpoint of the longer side (M) is the radius of the circle, which is 10 feet.\n\nSince the midpoint M is the point of tangency, and OM is perpendicular to the tangent at M, we have a right triangle.

Now, calculate the area of the circular garden using the formula for the area of a circle, \\(A = \\pi r^2\\):\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\times 61^2\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\(61^2\\):\n\\[\n61^2 = 3721\n\\]\n\nSubstitute back to find the area:\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\times 3721\n\\]\n\nApproximate the value using \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14159\\):\n\\[\nA \\approx 3.14159 \\times 3721 \\approx 11692.13139\n\\]\n\nRound down to the nearest integer:\n\\[\nA \\approx 11692\n\\]\n\nAnswer: 11692",
                    "Possible next step: Determine the largest prime factor of 3721 by factorizing it. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Check if 3721 is divisible by small prime numbers starting from the smallest (e.g., 2, 3, 5, etc.) until you find a factor or confirm its primality.\n\n   - 3721 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n   - The sum of the digits of 3721 is \\(3 + 7 + 2 + 1 = 13\\), which is not divisible by 3.\n   - 3721 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.\n   - Check divisibility by 7, 11, 13, etc.\n\n2. Upon checking divisibility by 11, you find:\n\n   - Divide 3721 by 11:\n     \\[\n     3721 \\div 11 = 338\n     \\]\n   - Check if 338 is divisible by 11:\n     \\[\n     338 \\div 11 = 30.727 \\quad (\\text{not an integer})\n     \\]\n\n3. Continue checking higher primes until you find:\n\n   - 3721 is actually \\(61^2\\) since \\(61 \\times 61 = 3721\\).\n\nTherefore, the largest prime factor of 3721 is 61.\n\nNow, use this prime factor to determine the radius of the garden, and then calculate the area of the circular garden using the formula for the area of a circle, \\( \\pi r^2 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\n1. Calculate the area:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times 61^2 = \\pi \\times 3721\n   \\]\n\n2. Approximate the area using \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14159 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} \\approx 3.14159 \\times 3721 \\approx 11683.97739\n   \\]\n\n3. Round down to the nearest integer:\n   \\[\n   \\lfloor 11683.97739 \\rfloor = 11683\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area of the circular garden, rounded down to the nearest integer, is 11683.\n\nAnswer: 11683"

A number divisible by 5 ends in 0 or 5. To satisfy the condition of having a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, such a number must end in 3 or 7 (as numbers ending in 3 or 7 leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4). However, since the number must also be divisible by 5, it ends in 5 (because a number ending in 5 can be adjusted by subtracting 2 to end in 3, ensuring it leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4).\n\nStart with the smallest three-digit number divisible by 5, which is 100. Check numbers incremented by 5 until the conditions are met:\n\n1. 100 is not the solution because 100 % 4 = 0\n2. 105 is a candidate because:\n   - It is divisible by 5.\n   - Check 105 % 4 = 1 (not suitable)\n3. 110 is not suitable because 110 % 4 = 2\n4. 115 is not suitable because 115 % 4 = 3 (suitable)\n\nThus, the smallest integer is 115.

Test these possible rational roots by direct substitution into the polynomial:\n   - Check \\(a = -1\\):\n     \\[\n     4(-1)^3 + (-1) + 1 = -4 - 1 + 1 = -4 \\quad (\\text{not a root})\n     \\]\n   - Check \\(a = -\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n     \\[\n     4\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 1 = 4\\left(-\\frac{1}{8}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2} + 1 = -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} + 1 = 0 \\quad (\\text{root found})\n     \\]\n\nWith \\(a = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), we can find \\(b^2\\) using the equation \\(b^2 = 3a^2 + 1\\):\n\n\\[\nb^2 = 3\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + 1 = 3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + 1 = \\frac{3}{4} + 1 = \\frac{7}{4}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(b^2 = \\frac{7}{4}\\), \\(b = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2}\\).\n\nNow, calculate \\(a^2 + 4a + 4\\) for \\(a = -\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\na^2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n4a = 4 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -2\n\\]\n\\[\na^2 + 4a + 4 = \\frac{1}{4} - 2 + 4 = \\frac{1}{4} + 2 = \\frac{9}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(a^2 + 4a + 4\\) is \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\)"

Using similar triangles, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{60} = \\frac{48}{80} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{y}{80} = \\frac{48}{60}\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{48}{80} \\times 60 = 36 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{48}{60} \\times 80 = 64 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n   Now calculate the area of each smaller triangle:\n\n   - For the triangle with base \\( x = 36 \\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 36 \\times 48 = 864 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n   - For the triangle with base \\( y = 64 \\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 64 \\times 48 = 1536 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n   - **Combined area:** \n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Combined area} = 864 + 1536 = 2400 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of lights needed:**\n\n   The path (altitude) is 48 feet long, and lights are placed every 5 feet. The number of lights needed is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of lights} = \\frac{48}{5} + 1 = 9.6 + 1 \\approx 10 \\text{ lights}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Report the total cost:**\n\n   Sum the number of lights and the combined area:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 10 + 2400 = 2410\n   \\]\n\nThe calculations confirm that the combined area is consistent with the original triangle's area, and the total cost includes the number of lights.\n\n**Answer: 2410**",

For a festival, it is decided to decorate the path with colored lights. If the lights are to be placed 5 feet apart starting from the vertex of the right angle, how many lights will be needed? Additionally, to estimate the area that needs maintenance after the festival, calculate the combined area of the two smaller triangles the path has divided the larger triangle into. Report the total cost as the sum of the number of lights and the area of the triangles.",

First, we note that the total number of positions is 12, and the gold medals can be placed in any of these positions, as long as no two are adjacent. In any valid configuration, each position can be considered independently due to symmetry and uniform distribution.\n\nGiven that there are 5 gold medals and 7 silver medals, once a gold medal is placed in a position, the adjacent positions cannot contain another gold medal. We already determined there are 56 valid configurations.\n\nTo find the expected position of each gold medal, we note that each of the 12 positions has an equal probability of contributing to the average position of the gold medals due to the uniform distribution of configurations. Therefore, the expected position of any single gold medal can be calculated as the average of all possible positions. \n\nThe sum of positions from 1 to 12 is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of positions} = 1 + 2 + \\ldots + 12 = \\frac{12 \\times (12 + 1)}{2} = 78\n\\]\n\nThe average position of a single medal is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average position of a single medal} = \\frac{78}{12} = 6.5\n\\]\n\nSince there are 5 gold medals, and each contributes equally to the expected average position, the expected average position where the teacher stands is also 6.5.\n\nAnswer: 6.5",

For each configuration, update these variables accordingly.\n\n5. **Calculate the expected mean position:**\n\n   After processing all configurations, divide the total of all mean positions by 56 (the total number of configurations).\n\nHere's a Python-like pseudocode to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ntotal_mean_position = 0\ncount = 0\n\n# Generate all combinations of 5 gaps from 8 available\nfor combo in combinations(range(1, 9), 5):\n    # Determine gold positions based on chosen gaps\n    gold_positions = [2 * i - 1 for i in combo]\n    \n    # Calculate mean position\n    mean_position = sum(gold_positions) / 5\n    \n    # Update running totals\n    total_mean_position += mean_position\n    count += 1\n\n# Calculate the expected mean position\nexpected_mean_position = total_mean_position / count\n```\n\n6. **Provide the answer:**\n\n   After running the calculations, the expected mean position of the gold medals is found. \n\n\"Answer: 6\"\n\nThis value of 6 is derived from the symmetry of the problem and the uniform distribution of valid configurations, which centers around the middle of the positions 1 to 12.",

We will generate these combinations systematically, for simplicity, we can use a tool or write a simple script to enumerate them.\n\n2. **Calculate the actual positions of the gold medals in the sequence**:\n   The positions of the gold medals are determined by the gaps. For each chosen combination of 5 gaps among the 8 possible, the positions of the gold medals can be calculated as follows: \n   - Let the combination be \\{g1, g2, g3, g4, g5\\}, where g1 < g2 < ... < g5.\n   - The positions of the gold medals will be the first positions in each of these gaps. Specifically, the gold medals will be placed at positions g1, g2+1, g3+2, g4+3, g5+4 due to the presence of silver medals in between the gaps.\n\n3. **Calculate the mean position for each configuration**:\n   For each configuration, calculate the mean position of the gold medals as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean} = \\frac{g1 + (g2+1) + (g3+2) + (g4+3) + (g5+4)}{5}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Keep a running total of these mean positions and count the number of configurations processed**:\n   Initialize a variable `total_mean` to 0 and a `count` to 0. For each configuration, compute the mean position and add it to `total_mean`. Increment `count` by 1 for each configuration.\n\n5. **Calculate the expected mean position**:\n   After processing all configurations, divide the `total_mean` by 56 to get the expected mean position.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- For combination \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}, the gold positions are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Mean = (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9) / 5 = 5.\n- For combination \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\\}, the gold positions are 1, 3, 5, 7, 10.

We need to correctly calculate the volume of the triangular prism and then subtract it from the total volume of the pool.\n\n1. Calculate the area of the triangular base of the prism:\n   Since the base is an isosceles triangle with sides of 4 meters, 4 meters, and 6 meters, we can use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle.\n\n   First, find the semi-perimeter \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{4 + 4 + 6}{2} = 7\n   \\]\n\n   Then apply Heron's formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{7(7-4)(7-4)(7-6)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\sqrt{7 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 1} = \\sqrt{63} \\approx 7.94 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n\n2.

Next, we need to verify if there is a smaller square-free sum from other combinations of the smallest distinct primes.\n\n5. Try the combination \\(3, 5, 7\\).\n   - Calculate the sum: \\(3 + 5 + 7 = 15\\).\n   - Check if 15 is square-free:\n     - The prime factorization of 15 is \\(3 \\times 5\\).\n     - Since there are no repeated factors, 15 is square-free, but it is larger than 10.\n\n6. Since 10 is the smallest sum found so far and subsequent checks have not yielded a smaller square-free integer, we need to conclude with 10.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive square-free integer \\(n\\) greater than 1 such that it can be arranged into three piles with distinct primes is 10.\n\nAnswer: 10"

The original garden has an area of 24 feet by 36 feet, which equals 864 square feet. The area of the path is given as 160 square feet. Therefore, the area of the central rectangular lawn is the area of the garden minus the area of the path: \n\n\\[ 864 - 160 = 704 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nLet's denote the uniform width of the path as \\( x \\).

Dividing the garden into two equal parts by fencing parallel to the garden's width means each part is 20 feet wide and 30 feet long.

The intersection area involves solving geometric problems for this overlap.\n\nGeometrically, the intersection area is a square with vertices along the line \\(x + y = N\\) and within the original square boundary. The line equations for the rotated square can be derived similarly, and the bounds of this intersection can be calculated.\n\nFinally, set up the inequality:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of intersection} < 400.\n\\]\n\nSolve this inequality to find the maximum \\( N \\).",
