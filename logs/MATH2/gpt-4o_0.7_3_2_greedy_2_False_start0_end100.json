Since there are 10 friends sitting in a circle, we can number them from 0 to 9, where person 0 is the starting person. Each pass moves the ball to the person on the right, which corresponds to moving one position forward in this numbering system. To find out if the ball returns to the starting person after 9 passes, we need to calculate the position of the ball after 9 passes using the modulo operation:\n\nCalculate the final position = (starting position + 9) mod 10.\n\nFor the ball to return to the starting person (person 0), the final position must be 0. Therefore, set up the equation:\n\n(starting position + 9) mod 10 = 0.\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\nstarting position mod 10 = 1.\n\nSince starting position can be any number from 0 to 9, we can see that only when the starting position is 1 (i.e., starting with person 1), the ball will return to the starting person after 9 passes.

The width of the flower bed is 10 feet, and its length is \\( w + 5 = 15 \\) feet. The side length of the square vegetable patch is also 10 feet.\n\nNow that we have the dimensions, we can proceed to calculate the areas of the flower bed and the vegetable patch to determine the probability that a randomly chosen plant is from the vegetable patch.",
