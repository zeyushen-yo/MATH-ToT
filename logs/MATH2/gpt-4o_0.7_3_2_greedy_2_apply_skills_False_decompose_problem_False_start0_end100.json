                    "To solve the problem, we need to find all combinations of distributing 11 identical items into 3 distinct boxes such that each box contains a prime number of items. The prime numbers less than or equal to 11 are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. We need to find combinations of these primes that sum to 11 and consist of exactly 3 terms.\n\nLet's examine the possible combinations:\n\n1. Try using the largest prime number that is less than or equal to 11. Start with 7:\n   - 7 + 2 + 2 = 11 (valid combination)\n   - 7 + 3 + 1 = 11 (not valid since 1 is not a prime number)\n   - 7 + 5 = 12 (too large, discard)\n\n2. Try using the next largest prime number, 5:\n   - 5 + 3 + 3 = 11 (valid combination)\n   - 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 (4 is not a prime number)\n   - 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 (1 is not a prime number)\n\n3. Try using the next largest prime number, 3:\n   - 3 + 3 + 5 = 11 (already considered above)\n   - 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 (too small)\n   - 3 + 2 + 6 = 11 (6 is not a prime number)\n\n4. Try using the smallest prime number, 2:\n   - 2 + 2 + 7 = 11 (already considered above)\n   - 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 (too small)\n\nThe valid combinations are:\n- 7 + 2 + 2\n- 5 + 3 + 3\n\nSince the boxes are distinct, we must consider permutations of these combinations. For 7 + 2 + 2, the distinct arrangement is:\n- (7, 2, 2)\n\nFor 5 + 3 + 3, the distinct arrangements are:\n- (5, 3, 3)\n\nThe total number of ways to distribute the items is the number of distinct permutations of these combinations:\n- (7, 2, 2) has 3 permutations: (7, 2, 2), (2, 7, 2), (2, 2, 7)\n- (5, 3, 3) has 3 permutations: (5, 3, 3), (3, 5, 3), (3, 3, 5)\n\nAdding them gives us 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nAnswer: 6"
