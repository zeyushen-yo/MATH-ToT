The area of one desk is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\). Then, we need to find the total area of the square study area \\( A \\) such that \\( A \\) is a multiple of \\( 9 \\). Since each desk covers \\( 6 \\) square units, we will express the total area \\( A \\) in terms of the number of desks \\( k \\): \\( A = 6k \\). Thus, we need \\( 6k \\) to be a multiple of \\( 9 \\). \n\nNext, we will analyze what conditions \\( k \\) must satisfy for \\( 6k \\) to be divisible by \\( 9 \\). Since \\( 6 = 2 \\times 3 \\), we can see that \\( k \\) must be such that \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times k \\) is a multiple of \\( 9 \\).

Specifically, determine the effective width and height of the area covered by each tile when placed at this angle, which will help assess how many tiles can fit within the rectangular dimensions of the field without overlap. \n\nTo do this, we need to compute the dimensions of the bounding square that contains a tile rotated at 45 degrees. The effective width (and height, since the tile is square) will be given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Effective side length} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.707 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThis means, when calculating the effective coverage of the tiles, we will use this value to determine how many tiles can fit within the original dimensions of the field. \n\nNext, we will find how many tiles can fit along the width and length of the rectangular field:\n\n1. For the width (10 meters):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of tiles along width} = \\frac{10}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 10 \\times 1.414 \\approx 14.14 \\text{ tiles}\n\\]\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a tile, we will take only 14 tiles.\n\n2.

Specifically, determine the effective width and height of the area covered by each tile when placed at this angle, which will help assess how many tiles can fit within the rectangular dimensions of the field without overlap. \n\nTo do this, we need to compute the dimensions of the bounding square that contains a tile rotated at 45 degrees. The effective width (and height, since the tile is square) will be given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Effective side length} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.707 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThis means, when calculating the effective coverage of the tiles, we will use this value to determine how many tiles can fit within the original dimensions of the field. \n\nNext, we will find how many tiles can fit along the width and length of the rectangular field:\n\n1. For the width (10 meters):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of tiles along width} = \\frac{10}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 10 \\times 1.414 \\approx 14.14 \\text{ tiles}\n\\]\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a tile, we will take only 14 tiles.\n\n2.

Calculate the maximum number of 45-gram pieces:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Maximum pieces} = \\frac{999.6 \\text{ grams}}{45 \\text{ grams/piece}} = 22.2 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n   Taking the whole number, we get 22 pieces.\n\n2.
