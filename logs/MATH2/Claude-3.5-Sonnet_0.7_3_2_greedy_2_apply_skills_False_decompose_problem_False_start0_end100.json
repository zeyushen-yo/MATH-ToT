When a 1m\u00b2 tile is placed at 45\u00b0:\n   - The actual area remains 1m\u00b2\n   - The footprint in the field's orientation is a square with diagonal = 1m\n   - If diagonal is 1m, then the side length of the footprint is 1/\u221a2 meters\n\n2. Now let's recalculate how many tiles can fit:\n   - Width = 10m, can fit floor(10/(1/\u221a2)) = floor(10\u221a2) \u2248 14 tiles\n   - Length = 20m, can fit floor(20/(1/\u221a2)) = floor(20\u221a2) \u2248 28 tiles\n\n3. Total tiles possible = 14 \u00d7 28 = 392 tiles\n   Area covered by tiles = 392m\u00b2\n\nThis result shows our calculation must still be wrong because we can't cover more than the field's area (200m\u00b2). Let's redo the approach considering both the field dimensions and tile orientation more carefully.\n\nPossible next step: Let's solve this by considering that the field must first be rotated 45\u00b0 relative to the tiles to get the correct calculation.",

The field's new dimensions after rotation can be found using the rotation formula:\n   - New width = 10\u221a2 meters (original width \u00d7 \u221a2)\n   - New length = 20\u221a2 meters (original length \u00d7 \u221a2)\n\n2. Now, since the tiles are aligned with our coordinate system:\n   - Along the new width, we can fit floor(10\u221a2) \u2248 14 tiles\n   - Along the new length, we can fit floor(20\u221a2) \u2248 28 tiles\n\n3. Total number of complete 1m\u00b2 tiles = 14 \u00d7 28 = 392 tiles\n   Each tile covers exactly 1m\u00b2 in actual area.\n   Total area covered = 392m\u00b2\n\nLet me calculate the actual area covered relative to the original 200m\u00b2 field.",

Original field (10m \u00d7 20m) rotated 45\u00b0 becomes a parallelogram relative to the tile grid.\n   - The height (perpendicular to the base) of this parallelogram = 10 \u00d7 cos(45\u00b0) = 10/\u221a2 meters\n   - The base = 20 \u00d7 cos(45\u00b0) = 20/\u221a2 meters\n\n2. Now we can place 1m \u00d7 1m tiles in a regular grid:\n   - Number of tiles vertically = floor(10/\u221a2) \u2248 7 tiles\n   - Number of tiles horizontally = floor(20/\u221a2) \u2248 14 tiles\n\n3.

Now, since tiles are aligned with our viewing grid:\n   - We can fit floor(21.21) = 21 tiles horizontally\n   - We can fit floor(21.21) = 21 tiles vertically\n\n3. Each tile is 1m\u00b2, and we can fit 21\u00d721 = 441 tiles in total\n   Let's calculate the grassy area:\n   - Total field area = 200m\u00b2\n   - Area covered by tiles = 441m\u00b2\n   (This is still wrong as we're getting more area covered than the field size)\n\nLet me recalculate considering that the rotated dimensions represent diagonals of the coverage area.",
