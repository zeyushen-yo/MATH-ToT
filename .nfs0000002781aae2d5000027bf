How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.",finding_vertical_asymptotes,"The skill required to solve the problem is the ability to determine where the function is undefined, typically where the denominator of the fraction equals zero, resulting in vertical asymptotes. Identifying and solving the equation $x^2 + x - 6 = 0$ (the denominator) for $x$ is essential in finding the values that cause the function to be undefined, hence indicating vertical asymptotes."
"You have two circles, one with radius $r$ and the other with radius $R$. You wish for the difference in the areas of these two circles to be less than or equal to 5$\pi$. If $r+R=10$, what is the maximum difference in the lengths of the radii?","We want $\pi R^{2}-\pi r^{2}\leq 5\pi$. Dividing by $\pi$, we have $R^{2}-r^{2}\leq 5$. Factor the left-hand side to get $(R+r)(R-r)\leq 5$. Substituting 10 for $R+r$ gives $10(R-r)\leq 5 \implies R-r \leq 1/2$. So the maximum difference in the lengths of the radii is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.",skill_name: circle_geometry_and_quadratic_inequalities,"The problem involves calculating the areas of circles and dealing with the algebraic manipulation of quadratic inequalities. We need to understand the geometry of circles to relate the radii to their areas, represented by \(\pi r^2\) and \(\pi R^2\), and then apply quadratic inequality manipulation to solve for the constraints given in the problem."
