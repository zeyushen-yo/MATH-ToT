['Using the simplified problem and its solution as an example, propose a possible first step to solve the original problem. Your step needs to be concrete. In other words, you not only need to propose what you can do, but you should actually do it.\n\nOriginal Problem:\nExpress solutions to the inequality $\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{x-1} \\geq \\frac{1}{8} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+2}$ in terms of intervals on the real line.\n\nExample simplified problem and solution:\nSimplified Problem:\n[Your simplified problem]".\nThen, we\'ll work on solving the inequality.\n\nSimplified Problem:\n[Insert your simplified problem here] \n\nNote: I\'ll wait for your response before providing the next step in solving the inequality. \n\nAlso, I\'ll follow the format you specified for providing the final answer. \n\nPlease go ahead and simplify the problem! \n\n## Step 1: Rewrite the inequality to make it easier to solve\nTo simplify the given inequality, let\'s first rewrite it to have the same base on both sides. This can be achieved by expressing $\\frac{1}{8}$ as $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ as $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2$. The inequality becomes $\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x-1} \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the properties of exponents to simplify the inequality\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can simplify the inequality further by combining the exponents on the right-hand side. This results in $\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x-1} \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the inequality with the same base on both sides\nTo compare the exponents directly, we can rewrite the inequality with the same base on both sides. This can be achieved by multiplying both sides by $2^{x-1}$ and dividing both sides by $2^{x+5}$. The inequality becomes $2^{x-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x-1} \\geq 1$, which simplifies to $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Express the inequality in terms of a single exponential expression\nSince $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq 1$, we can rewrite it as $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^0$, which simplifies to $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the inequality by comparing the exponents\nTo solve the inequality, we can compare the exponents by setting $2x-1 \\geq 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Express the solution in interval notation\nThe solution to the inequality can be expressed in interval notation as $x \\in \\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\infty\\right)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\infty\\right)}$\n\n Solution to Simplified Problem:\nSolve the following simplified problem. Your solution will be used for solving a harder version of this problem, so you should present your critical reasoning steps accurately and clearly.\n\nSimplified Problem:\n[Your simplified problem]".\nThen, we\'ll work on solving the inequality.\n\nSimplified Problem:\n[Insert your simplified problem here] \n\nNote: I\'ll wait for your response before providing the next step in solving the inequality. \n\nAlso, I\'ll follow the format you specified for providing the final answer. \n\nPlease go ahead and simplify the problem! \n\n## Step 1: Rewrite the inequality to make it easier to solve\nTo simplify the given inequality, let\'s first rewrite it to have the same base on both sides.

This can be achieved by expressing $\\frac{1}{8}$ as $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ as $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2$. The inequality becomes $\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x-1} \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the properties of exponents to simplify the inequality\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can simplify the inequality further by combining the exponents on the right-hand side. This results in $\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x-1} \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the inequality with the same base on both sides\nTo compare the exponents directly, we can rewrite the inequality with the same base on both sides. This can be achieved by multiplying both sides by $2^{x-1}$ and dividing both sides by $2^{x+5}$. The inequality becomes $2^{x-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x-1} \\geq 1$, which simplifies to $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Express the inequality in terms of a single exponential expression\nSince $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq 1$, we can rewrite it as $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^0$, which simplifies to $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the inequality by comparing the exponents\nTo solve the inequality, we can compare the exponents by setting $2x-1 \\geq 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Express the solution in interval notation\nThe solution to the inequality can be expressed in interval notation as $x \\in \\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\infty\\right)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\infty\\right)}$\n\n Solution to Simplified Problem:\nSolve the following simplified problem.

Your step needs to be concrete. In other words, you not only need to propose what you can do, but you should actually do it.\n\nOriginal Problem:\nExpress solutions to the inequality $\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{x-1} \\geq \\frac{1}{8} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+2}$ in terms of intervals on the real line.\n\nExample simplified problem and solution:\nSimplified Problem:\n[Your simplified problem]".\nThen, we\'ll work on solving the inequality.\n\nSimplified Problem:\n[Insert your simplified problem here] \n\nNote: I\'ll wait for your response before providing the next step in solving the inequality. \n\nAlso, I\'ll follow the format you specified for providing the final answer. \n\nPlease go ahead and simplify the problem! \n\n## Step 1: Rewrite the inequality to make it easier to solve\nTo simplify the given inequality, let\'s first rewrite it to have the same base on both sides. This can be achieved by expressing $\\frac{1}{8}$ as $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ as $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2$.

This can be achieved by multiplying both sides by $2^{x-1}$ and dividing both sides by $2^{x+5}$. The inequality becomes $2^{x-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x-1} \\geq 1$, which simplifies to $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Express the inequality in terms of a single exponential expression\nSince $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq 1$, we can rewrite it as $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^0$, which simplifies to $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2x-1} \\geq 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the inequality by comparing the exponents\nTo solve the inequality, we can compare the exponents by setting $2x-1 \\geq 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Express the solution in interval notation\nThe solution to the inequality can be expressed in interval notation as $x \\in \\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\infty\\right)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\infty\\right)}$\n\n Solution to Simplified Problem:\nSolve the following simplified problem.
