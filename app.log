Find the values of $x$ for which $f(x) \\geq 0$.\n\n\n## Step 1: Find the derivative of $f(x)$\nTo find the critical points, we need to find the derivative of $f(x)$. Using the chain rule and the product rule, we get $f\'(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{x-1} - \\frac{1}{8} \\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for $x$\nTo find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for $x$.
