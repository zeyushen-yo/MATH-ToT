**1. Simplify the left-hand side:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{x-1} = \frac{1}{2} \left(2^{-2}\right)^{x-1} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^{-2(x-1)} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^{-2x+2} = 2^{-2x+2-1} = 2^{-2x+1}
   \]

**2. Simplify the right-hand side:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{8} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+2} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 2^{-x-2} = 2^{-3} \cdot 2^{-x-2} = 2^{-x-5}
   \]

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
2^{-2x+1} \geq 2^{-x-5}
\]

**3. Exponents Manipulation:**
Since the bases are the same and greater than 1, we can solve the inequality with respect to  the exponents:
\[
-2x + 1 \geq -x - 5
\]

**4. Solve the derived linear inequality:**
\[
-2x + 1 \geq -x - 5
\]
\[
-2x + x \geq -5 - 1
\]
\[
-x \geq -6
\]
\[  
x \leq 6
\]

**5. Expressing in interval notation:**
The solution to the inequality \(\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{x-1} \geq \frac{1}{8} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+2}\) can be expressed as:
\[
\boxed{x \in (-\infty, 6]}
\]
This specifies that any real number less than or equal to \(6\) is a solution to the inequality."

The ball is always passed to the person on the right. After $k$ passes the ball has moved to the person numbered $k+1$. Thus after $9$ passes the ball is with the person numbered $10$, who is immediately to the left of the person numbered $1$. 

Thus the probability that the ball returns to the person it started with after $9$ passes  is $\boxed{0}$. "
gpt-4-turbo,"[perimeter_and_area,  percentage_calculations]"," A rectangular garden has a perimeter of 70 feet. The garden is divided into two sections: a rectangular flower bed and a square vegetable patch. The length of the flower bed is 5 feet longer than its width, and the side length of the square vegetable patch is equal to the width of the flower bed. If a plant is randomly chosen from the garden, what is the probability that it is from the vegetable patch?","To solve this problem, let's define:
- \( w \) as the width of the rectangular flower bed.
- \( l \) as the length of the rectangular flower bed.
- \( s \) as the side length of the square vegetable patch.

From the problem description, we know:
1. \( l = w + 5 \)
2. \( s = w \)
3. The perimeter of the garden \( P = 70 \) feet.

The perimeter \( P \) of the garden is given by the combined perimeters of the two sections minus the lengths of the shared sides twice (as it would be counted twice). We note that the flower bed and vegetable patch share 1 common side.

Thus the equation for the perimeter of the rectangle and the square is as follows, where we have substitute  \(s=w\).
\[ P = 2(l + w) + 4w -2w \]
Substituting for \(l\)
\[ P = 2(w + 5 + w) + 2w =  6w + 10 \]

Setting the expression equal to the garden's known perimeter:
\[ 6w + 10 = 70 \]
\[ 6w = 60 \]
\[ w = 10 \]

Thus, \( w = 10 \) feet, \( s = w = 10 \) feet, and \( l = w + 5 = 10+ 5 = 15 \) feet.

Next, calculate the area of each section:
- Area of the flower bed \( A_{flower} = l \times w = 15 \times 10= 150 \) square feet.
- Area of the vegetable patch \( A_{vegetable} = s^2 = 10^2 = 100 \) square feet.

The total area of the garden \( A_{total} = A_{flower} + A_{vegetable} = 150 + 100 = 250 \) square feet.

Finally, the probability that a randomly chosen plant is from the vegetable patch is given by the ratio of the area of the vegetable patch to the total area of the garden:
\[ P_{vegetable} = \frac{A_{vegetable}}{A_{total}} = \frac{100}{250} \]
\[ P_{vegetable} = 2/5 \]

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen plant is from the vegetable patch is $\boxed{2/5}$."

If the area of the walkway is equal to the 10th prime number times π square meters, what is the radius of the pond?","First, we need to find the 10th prime number. The prime numbers in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. Thus, the 10th prime number is 29.

The problem stipulates that the area of the walkway is 29π square meters. Let \( r \) be the radius of the pond in meters, so the radius of the outer boundary of the walkway (pond plus walkway) is \( r + 2 \) meters.

The area of the pond itself is \( \pi r^2 \) square meters, and the area of the entire circle including the walkway is \( \pi (r + 2)^2 \) square meters. The area of just the walkway is therefore:
\[ \pi (r + 2)^2 - \pi r^2 = 29 \pi. \]

Expanding and simplifying the left-hand expression, we get:
\[ \pi ((r + 2)^2 - r^2) = 29 \pi, \]
\[ (r + 2)^2 - r^2 = 29, \]
\[ r^2 + 4r + 4 - r^2 = 29, \]
\[ 4r + 4 = 29, \]
\[ 4r = 25, \]
\[ r = \frac{25}{4} = 6.25. \]

Hence, the radius of the pond is \( r = 6.25 \) meters.

The answer is $\boxed{6.25}$ meters."
gpt-4-turbo,"[probability_and_combinatorics, function_skills]"," Suppose g(n, k) is the number of ways to distribute ( n ) identical items into  k  distinct boxes, where the number of items in each box is a prime number. If no such way exists, g(n, k) is defined to be 0. What is g(11, 3)?","To find \( g(11, 3) \) where \( g(n, k) \) is the number of ways to distribute \( n \) identical items into \( k \) distinct boxes, with each box receiving a prime number of items, we now need to distribute 11 items across 3 boxes with each box containing a prime count of items. 

**Prime Numbers Under 11:**
The prime numbers less than or equal to 11 which we can use to distribute among the boxes are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. The number of items in each box is one of these numbers. However, the boxes themselves are distinct (i.e., not exchangeable). 

**Step 1: Find Combinations of Primes that Sum to 11 for Three Boxes:**
The problem involves finding sum combinations of these primes, totaled up to 11, spread across three boxes.  The question allows the same prime to be used in different boxes. 

Possible distributions:
- \( 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \) (This fails since it does not total 11).
- \( 2 + 2 + 7 = 11 \) (This works though a repeat of 2 is necessary).
- \(3 + 3 + 5= 11\) (This works though a repeat of 3 is necessary).
- \( 2 + 3 + 7 = 12 \) (This fails since it does not total 11).


**Step 2: Calculate Exact Combinations:**
- With the restriction of all numbers needing to be prime and no involved zeros, the valid combinations  is \( 2 + 2 + 7 = 11 \)  and
\( 3 + 3 + 5  = 11 \)  . We note that both have one repeated number and one unique number. 

- As for \( 2 + 2 + 7 = 11 \),  although the number 2 is repeated, the boxes are distinct. Thus there are \(3 \) different ways  to choose the box that contains \(7\) items. 

The same holds for \( 3 + 3 + 5 = 11 \), where there are  \(3 \) different ways  to choose the box that contains \(5\) items. 


**Conclusion:**
Hence,  the number of total ways is  3 + 3 =6. The answer is $\boxed{6}$. "
gpt-4-turbo,"[function_composition_skills, number_theory_skills]"," If $f(x) = \frac{3x + 1}{5}$ and $g(x) = \sqrt{x - 2}$, what is the smallest integer $x$ such that $f(g(x))$ is an integer?","To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest integer \( x \) such that \( f(g(x)) \) is an integer. 

1. **Compose the Functions:**
   - First, compute \( g(x) \): \( g(x) = \sqrt{x - 2} \)
   - Then, substitute \( g(x) \) into \( f(x) \) to get \( f(g(x)) \):
     \[
     f(g(x)) = f(\sqrt{x - 2}) = \frac{3 \sqrt{x - 2} + 1}{5}
     \]

2. **Conditions for \( f(g(x)) \) being an integer:**
   - For \( \sqrt{x - 2} \) to be defined, \( x - 2 \geq 0 \), hence \( x \geq 2 \).
   - For \( f(g(x)) \) to be an integer:
     \[
     3 \sqrt{x - 2} + 1 \text{ must be divisible by } 5.
     \]
   This suggests:
   \[
   3 \sqrt{x - 2} + 1 = 5k \text{ for some integer } k.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   3 \sqrt{x - 2} = 5k - 1.
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{x - 2} = \frac{5k - 1}{3}
   \]

3. **Assessing \( \sqrt{x - 2} \):**
   - \( \sqrt{x - 2} = \frac{5k - 1}{3} \) must result in a perfect square since \( \sqrt{x - 2} \) is the square root function. Therefore, \( \frac{5k - 1}{3} \) must also be a perfect square.
   - We check the square root condition by squaring both sides:
     \[
     x - 2 = \left(\frac{5k - 1}{3}\right)^2.
     \]
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{5k - 1}{3}\right)^2 + 2.
     \]
   - We need to find the smallest \( k \) such that both \( \frac{5k - 1}{3} \) and \( \left(\frac{5k - 1}{3}\right)^2 \) are perfect squares.

4. **Testing for Integer Values:**
   - First test for \( k = 1 \):
     \[
     \frac{5 \times 1 - 1}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ (not an integer)}
     \]
   - Test for \( k = 2 \):
     \[
     \frac{5 \times 2 - 1}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ (integer and a perfect square)}
     \]
     \[
     x = 3^2 + 2 = 11 \text{ (integer)}
     \]

Thus, the smallest integer \( x \) for which \( f(g(x)) \) is an integer is  $boxed{ x = 11} $."
gpt-4-turbo,"[solving_linear_equation, number_theory_skills]",Making $a$ units of good A requires $(a-5)/3$ units of good C. Making $b$ units of good B requires $(2b-3)/5$ units of good D. The factory's supply chain only supplies integer units of goods C and D and requires using equal amounts of goods C and D. What is the minimum production of goods A and B so that no inventory is left?,"To find the minimum production of goods A and B that uses equal amounts of goods C and D, and leaves no inventory, we need to ensure the requirements for goods C and D, derived from A and B respectively, match. Given the expressions for how much of goods C and D are required:

1. Units of good C needed for \(a\) units of good A: \( \frac{a-5}{3} \)
2. Units of good D needed for \(b\) units of good B: \( \frac{2b-3}{5} \)

Both expressions must result in integers, and they must equal each other: 
\[ \frac{a-5}{3} = \frac{2b-3}{5} \]

We look for the smallest integer values of \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy this equation. We start by cross-multiplying:
\[ 5(a-5) = 3(2b-3) \]
\[ 5a - 25 = 6b - 9 \]
\[ 5a - 6b = 16 \]

To satisfy this equation and also ensure that \(a-5\) is divisible by 3 and \(2b-3\) divisible by 5, we need to find values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that both conditions are met:

1. \(a - 5\) must be a multiple of 3.
2. \(2b - 3\) must be a multiple of 5.

Testing integer values of \(a\) and \(b\) that meet these conditions:
- \(a = 3k + 5\) for integers \(k\).
- \(2b = 5m + 3\) for integers \(m\), or \(b = \frac{5m + 3}{2}\).

Substituting \(a = 3k + 5\) into the first equation:
\[ 5(3k + 5) - 6b = 16 \]
\[ 15k + 25 - 6b = 16 \]
\[ 15k - 6b = -9 \]

Substituting \(b = \frac{5m + 3}{2}\):
\[ 15k - 6 \left( \frac{5m + 3}{2} \right) = -9 \]
\[ 15k - 15m - 9 = -9 \]
\[ 15k - 15m = 0 \]
\[ k = m \]

Thus \(k\) and \(m\) must be the same integer; moreover, they need to be the smallest values such that \(b\) is an integer:
- \(b = \frac{5k + 3}{2} \)
\(b\) will be an integer if \(5k + 3\) is even, or \(k\) is odd.

Trying the smallest odd \(k = 1\), we have:
- \(a = 3(1) + 5 = 8\)
- \(b = \frac{5(1) + 3}{2} = 4\)

Verification:
- \(C = \frac{8-5}{3} = 1\)
- \(D = \frac{2(4)-3}{5} = 1\)

Both are integers, and they are equal. Thus, the minimum production that meets all conditions is:
\boxed{8 units of good A and 4 units of good B}."

14^3 = (x^2 + 1/x^2)^3 = x^6 + 1/x^6 + 3x^2 + 3/x^2.$

Thus $x^6 + 1/x^6 + 3 \times 14 = 14^3 = 2744.$

Thus $x^6 + 1/x^6 = 2744 - 42 = 2702$. 

But we also know  $x^6 + 1/x^6 +2 = (x^3 + 1/x^3)^2.$

Thus we conclude $(x^3 + 1/x^3)^2 = 2702 + 2$.

Taking square roots and using that $x$ is positive, we obtain $x^3 + 1/x^3 = \sqrt{2704}$. Since $2704 = 2^4 \times 13^2$,
we conclude $x^3 + 1/x^3 = 2^2\times 13 = 52$.

Thus it is a product of three consecutive integers. Thus exactly one of them is divisible by $3$ and at least one is divisible by $2$. For it to be divisible by $9$, the multiple of $3$ must actually be a multiple of $9$. Since $10 = 5 \times 2$ and $5$ is a prime, the only way it can be a divisor is if one of the numbers is a multiple of $5$. 

Thus we are looking for a $k$ such that one of $k-1, k, k+1$ is a multiple of $5$ and one of these is a multiple of $9$.  In other words, a multiple of $9$ and the multiple of $5$  whose difference is at most $2$. 

We first try values of $k$ under $100$. The multiples of $5$ are $5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95$,
and the multiples of $9$ are $9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99$. 

The possible nearby pairs from the two sequences are $9, 10$, $18, 20$, $25, 27$, $35, 36$, $45, 45$,  $54, 55$, $63, 65$, $70, 72$,  $80, 81$, $90, 90$. 

Potential values of $k$ where $k(k-1)(k+1)$ is a multiple of $90$:

$k =9$ and $k=10$. But the sum of digits is $9$ and $1$, neither of which are prime.

$k= 19$. But the sum of digits is $10$, which is not a prime.

$k= 26$. But the sum of digits is $8$, which is not a prime.

$k= 35, 36$. But the sum of digits is $8$ and $9$ respectively neither of which are prime.

$k=44, 45, 46$.   But the sum of digits is $8$, $9$ and $10$ respectively none of which are prime.

$k=54, 55$. But the sum of digits is $9$ and $10$ respectively neither of which are prime.

$k=64$. But the sum of digits is $6+4 =10$, which is not a prime.

$k=71$.   But the sum of digits is $7+1 =8$, which is not a prime.

$k=80, 81$. But the sum of digits is $8$ and $9$ respectively neither of which are prime.

$k= 89, 90, 91$. Here for $k=89$ the sum of digits is $8+ 9=17$ which is indeed a prime.

The answer is $\boxed{k=89}$.

Thus we will ignore that constraint and look for all distinct sequences of $6$ consecutive beads. 

The possibilities are as follows.

1) All beads of a single color. Such bracelets are always possible, since there are arbitrarily long sequences of each color. 
Thus there are 3 types of such bracelets: all red, all blue and all green.

2) Beads of three different colors.  This is possible only if we can find sequences of $6$ consecutive beads that contain all colors.  This means the sequence contains all beads from one middle section and then a nonzero number of beads from two adjacent sections. Since the third section has length $8$ it is already too large to serve as the middle section. But the first blue section has $4$ beads, so  by picking all $4$ and then picking a red bead from the previous section and one green beed from the following section, we obtain $6$ consecutive beads that include all three colors. This is the only possible bracelet with beads of all three colors.

3) Beads of exactly two colors. Since the sections get arbitrarily large, we can get all possible combinations of pairs of successive colors: (red, blue), (blue, green), (green, red).

Now $f(x)$ can be rewritten as $(y+1)^2$  after substituting $y =2^{x+1}$.   It  is an increasing function for positive $y$ and hence an increasing function of $x$.  We want to find integer $x$ such that this function takes values in $[4, 49]$. 

We do trial and error. We first try positive integers.
For x =0, f(x) = 9. 
For x = 1, f(x) = 25. 
For x= 2, f(x) = 81, which is out of range.
So $x$ has to be less than 2.

Now we try negative integers.
For x=-1, f(x) =4.
For x=-2, f(x) = 9/4, which is out of range. 
So $x$ has to be greater than -2.

Thus the only integer values satisfying the condition are -1, 0,1. Their sum is $\boxed{0}$."
gpt-4-turbo,,A rectangular prism has dimensions that are integers. The sum of the dimensions is $28$ units and the diagonal of the prism can be expressed as $\sqrt{274}$. What is the volume of the prism?,"Let $l, w, h$ be the three dimensions. Then the sum of the dimensions$l+ h +w =28$ and the diagonal squared is $l^2 + w^2 + h^2 =274$.

This does not have a unique solution in general but we are given additional  information that the three variables are all integers. 

Since the sum of squares is $274$, the largest dimension is at most $\lfooor \sqrt{274} \rfloor$,  which is $19$.  The sum is $28$, so at least one dimension has to be greater than $28/3$, which means it is at least $10$. 

With some trial and error we find that $12, 9, 7$ sum to $28$ and $12^2 + 9^2 + 7^2 = 144 + 81 + 49 =274$.

$S_k$ = sum of all numbers from $1$ to $99$ that are divisible by $k$.
$S_k$ is a an arithmetic series and can be calculated 
We can calculate each of these using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
$S_k = \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)k)$
where $a$ is the first term, $k$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the number of terms.
[ S_3 = \frac{33}{2} \times (3 + 99) = \frac{33}{2} \times 102 = 33 \times 51 = 1683 ]
For $S_7$:
$a=7$, $d=7$, $n=14$ (since 99/7 = 14)
So $S_7 = \frac{14}{2}(2*7 + (14-1)*7) = 735$
For $S_{21}$:
$a=21$, $d=21$, $n=4$ (since 99/21 = 4)
So $S_{21} = \frac{4}{2}(2*21 + (4-1)*21) = 210$
Then $a_{100} = S_3 + S_7 - 2S_{21} = 1683 +735 -2\times 210 = 1998$.

Thus $a_{100}$ is $\boxed{1998}$. "

The constant term is 2 and the leading coefficient is 1, which suggests considering ( \pm 1, \pm 2 ) as possible roots. Testing these:
( P(1) = 1^3 - 3 \cdot 1 + 2 = 0 )
( P(-1) = (-1)^3 - 3(-1) + 2 = -1 + 3 + 2 = 4 ) (not a root)
( P(2) = 2^3 - 3 \cdot 2 + 2 = 8 - 6 + 2 = 4 ) (not a root)
( P(-2) = (-2)^3 - 3(-2) + 2 = -8 + 6 + 2 = 0 )
From this trial, we find two roots, ( x = 1 ) and ( x = -2 ). We need one more root, so let's divide ( P(x) ) by ( x - 1 ) and ( x + 2 ) and then resolve the quadratic.
Performing polynomial division, we find:
( P(x) = (x - 1)(x + 2)Q(x) )
( Q(x) = x - 1 )
Thus, ( P(x) = (x - 1)^2(x + 2) ).
This shows that ( x = 1 ) is also a double root, and ( x = -2 ) is a simple root.
Substituting $x=1$ in $x^2 + 4x +4$  gives $9$. Substituting $-2$  gives $0$.  
        Hence the answer is $9 +0 =9$.

The answer is $\boxed{9}$. "

Another tree species grows according to the quadratic function $Q(n) = 4n^2 + 4n + 2$, where the height of the tree after $n$ years is given by $Q(n)$ feet. Find the largest age such that the height of the second species of tree at this age exceeds that of the first species of tree.","Let's break this down step-by-step:
For the first tree species, its height H(n) triples each year, starting from 2 feet in year 1. So the height formula is:
H(n) = 2 * 3^(n-1), for n ≥ 1
For the second tree species, the height Q(n) is given by the quadratic formula:
Q(n) = 4n^2 + 4n + 2
We want to find the largest value of n where Q(n) > H(n). So let's set up that inequality:
4n^2 + 4n + 2 > 2 * 3^(n-1)
Calculating for n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5 we see $Q(n) > H(n)$ for $n \leq 4$ but not for $n=5$.
Since $H(n)$ grows exponentially, the inequality cannot be satisfied for $n>5$ either.

The length of this path can be found directly by the formula for the height ($h$) to the hypotenuse of a right triangle derived from the areas: $h = \frac{2 \cdot \text{Area of the triangle}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{2 \cdot 2400}{100} = 48$ feet.
Given the lights are placed 5 feet apart, starting with one at the vertex, we divide this path length by 5 and add one for the light at the start, resulting in $\frac{48}{5} + 1 = 9.6 + 1$.

If exactly two of these smaller square plots (along with their walkways) can fit along one side of the garden then what is the area of the walkways?,"Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
                        1. Calculate the total length of one side of the garden square:
                        * Each flower patch is 4 feet wide
                        * There are 2 flower patches in a row
                        * There are 3 walkway segments in a row (2 between patches, 1 on each end)
                        * Each walkway segment is 2 feet wide
So, the total length of one side is: (2 * 4 feet) + (3 * 2 feet) = 8 feet + 6 feet = 14 feet

                           * Area of a square = side length squared
So, the area of the garden is: 14 feet * 14 feet = 196 square feet

There are 4 patches that are in a corner. $4 \times 60 = 240$.

If the rose patch is planted on an edge, then 5 patches are touching this patch, and the mint can only be planted in $63 - 5 = 58$ patches.
There are $(7 + 5) \times 2 = 24$ patches that are on the edge. $24 \times 58 = 1392$.

If the rose is planted in the middle, then 8 patches are touching its patch, and the mint can only be planted in $63 - 8 = 55$ patches.
There are $7 \times 5 = 35$ patches that are in the middle. $35 \times 55 = 1925$.

gpt-4-turbo,," Consider a circle in the complex plane with its center at the origin $(0,0)$ and radius $9$. Let $z = a + bi$ be a point on this circle. Suppose a point is picked randomly on the circle. What is the probability that the product of its modulus and its imaginary part is at least $40.5$?","Let's reason step by step. 

**Step 1: Representing a Point on the Circle**
For a circle with radius 9 centered at the origin in the complex plane, any point on this circle, \( z \), can be represented as:
\[ z = 9e^{i\theta} \]
where \( \theta \) ranges from 0 to \( 2\pi \). This representation expands to:
\[ z = 9(\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)) \]
Thus, the modulus of \( z \) is 9, and the real part of \( z \) is \( 9\cos(\theta) \).

**Step 2: Condition for the Product**
We need to find when the product of the modulus and the real part of \( z \) is at least 40.5:
\[ |z| \cdot \operatorname{Re}(z) = 9 \cdot 9\cos(\theta) = 81\cos(\theta) \geq 40.5 \]
Solve for \( \cos(\theta) \):
\[ \cos(\theta) \geq \frac{40.5}{81} = 0.5 \]

**Step 3: Solving the Inequality for \( \theta \)**
The inequality \( \cos(\theta) \geq 0.5 \) holds for angles \( \theta \) in two ranges within the interval from 0 to \( 2\pi \):
1. \( \theta \) from 0 to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \)
2. \( \theta \) from \( \frac{5\pi}{3} \) to \( 2\pi \)

**Calculating the Total Angle**
The total angle where \( \cos(\theta) \geq 0.5 \) consists of the sum of the angles in these two ranges:
\[ \frac{\pi}{3} \text{ (first range)} + \left(2\pi - \frac{5\pi}{3}\right) \text{ (second range)} = \frac{\pi}{3} + \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \]

**Step 4: Finding the Probability**
The probability is the ratio of this angle to the total angle of \( 2\pi \):
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{2\pi}{3}}{2\pi} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Thus, the probability that the product of the modulus and the real part of \( z \) is at least 40.5 is $\boxed{1/3}$ "

1) First, let's write out the first few terms of the sequence to see the pattern:

   $a_{50} = 2500 + a_{49} = 2500 + (2401 + ... + 9 + 4 + 5)$
2) Let's denote the sum of the first 50 terms as $S_{50}$. Then the average will be $A_{50} = S_{50}/50$.
   $S_{50} = 2500 \times 1 + 2401 \times 2 + ... + 9 \times 48 + 4 \times 49 + 5 \times 50$
   $S_{50} = \sum_{n = 2}^{50} n^2 \times (51 - n) + 5 * 50$
   $S_{50} = 563500 + 2500 = 566000$
3) The average is:
   $A_{50} = 566000/50 = 11320$
8) The floor of 11320 is 11320.
Therefore, the floor of the average of the first 50 terms of this sequence is $\boxed{11320}$."

$m \leq x^2 - 4x + 6 + (3 - x) = x^2 - 5x + 9$
For $(3 - x) \leq 0$, i.e., when $x \geq 3$, the absolute value term simplifies to $-(3 - x) = x - 3$. The inequality becomes:
$m \leq x^2 - 4x + 6 + (x - 3) = x^2 - 3x + 3$

What is the total number of distinct, valid 3-digit numbers $abc$ that can be chosen for this competition?","First, recognize that to satisfy $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \neq 0$, none of the digits $a$, $b$, or $c$ can be 1 since subtracting 1 from any of them would make the product zero. This means $a$, $b$, and $c$ are chosen from the numbers 2 through 9.

Given $1 < a < b < c \leq 9$ and $a$, $b$, $c$ are integers, let's revise our initial choice pool for a, based on the condition that none of the chosen digits can result in a zero after subtraction by 1. The digits available are now from 2 to 9 only, for picking $a$, $b$, and $c$.

Now consider the number of ways to choose three distinct numbers from 2 to 9, ensuring they satisfy the ordered requirement $a < b < c$. This is a combinatorial problem, where we are choosing 3 out of 8 digits without regard to order since the inequality already imposes an order on our choices automatically. Therefore, the number of ways to do this is simply the combination of 8 items taken 3 at a time, noted as ${8 \choose 3}$.

Combining these insights, the total number of distinct, valid 3-digit numbers $abc$ that can be chosen is calculated by:

$${8 \choose 3} = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56$$

$11 \times 13 \times 17 = 2431$

When we divide $2431$ by $5$, we find that $2431 \div 5 = 486$ with a remainder of $1$. So, $2431$ does not fulfill the condition.

The next combination would involve replacing one of the primes with the next smallest two-digit prime which is $19$, leading to combinations like $11 \times 13 \times 19$, $11 \times 17 \times 19$, and $13 \times 17 \times 19$. We should test these combinations in ascending order:

- For $11 \times 13 \times 19 = 2717$, dividing by 5 gives a remainder $2$. Thus, $2717$ is the smallest such number that when divided by $5$ gives a remainder of $2$ and can be expressed as a product of three distinct two-digit prime numbers.

Therefore, the solution is $\boxed{2717}$."

This represents the product of two consecutive integers, which is the factorization part of the problem.

Next, we need to find a value for $x$ such that $x(x - 1)$ is divisible by both $10$ and $7$. This is equivalent to being divisible by $2$, $5$, and $7$. 

Since one of $x$ and $x - 1$ is guaranteed to be an even number, $x(x - 1)$ is always divisible by $2$.

Next, $x(x - 1)$ is divisible by both $5$ and $7$ in the following four cases:
(1) $x$ is divisible by $5$ and $x - 1$ is divisible by $7$
(2) $x$ is divisible by $7$ and $x - 1$ is divisible by $5$

It is not allowed to overlap the tiles of to cut them, but if a complete tiling is not possible, it is allowed to plant grass in the un-tiled area. What is the minimum area of the grassy regions of the field?","If $w$ is the width then the length is $2w$ and the area is $2w^2 = 200$. Thus $w=10$ and $l =20$.

We first rotate one square tile by $45$ degrees and place it in the top left corner. We place other square tiles horizontally, ensuring that the diagonal of the square touches the diagonal of the neighboring tiles. Since $\frac{20}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 14.1$, the we can place $14$ tiles in the first row.

Next, we place the next row of square tiles such that each tile fits right in between two neighboring tiles from the first row. To count the number of tiles we can fit in this row, we need to account for the fact that each tile is now shifted by half a diagonal to the right. Since $\frac{20}{\sqrt{2}} - 0.5 \approx 13.6$, we can place $13$ tiles in the second row.

All odd numbered rows can be an identical copy of the first row, and all even numbered rows can be an identical copy of the second row. 

Note that
1. height of row 1 = 1 diagonal
2. height of row 2 = 1.5 diagonal
3. height of row 3 = 2 diagonal

Since $\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 7.1 < 7.5$, row 13 fits in the field, but row 14 does not fit in the field. There are $7$ odd numbered rows, each with $14$ tiles, and $6$ even numbered rows, each with $13$ tiles.

Therefore, we have $7 \times 14 + 6 \times 13 = 176$ square meters covered by the tiles.

If this pattern continues indefinitely, what is the real part of the product of the 10th and 20th terms of this sequence?","First, let's find the 10th and 20th terms of the sequence.

For the real parts, the sequence starts at $2$ and increases by $2$ for each subsequent term. This can be generalized by the formula $2n$, where $n$ is the term number. Therefore, the real parts of the 10th and 20th terms are $2(10) = 20$ and $2(20) = 40$, respectively.

For the imaginary parts, it resembles an arithmetic sequence starting at $1$ with a common difference of $1$. So, the $n$th term can be generally represented as $n \cdot i$. Therefore, the imaginary parts of the 10th and 20th terms are $10i$ and $20i$, respectively.

Thus, the 10th term is $20 + 10i$, and the 20th term is $40 + 20i$.

To find the real part of the product of the 10th and 20th terms, we use the formula for multiplying complex numbers: $(a+bi)(c+di) = ac + adi + bci + bdi^2$. Since $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to $(a+bi)(c+di) = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i$.

Multiplying $20 + 10i$ and $40 + 20i$:

Real part: $20 \cdot 40 - 10 \cdot 20 = 800 - 200 = 600$.

Therefore, the real part of the product of the 10th and 20th terms of the given sequence is $\boxed{600}$."
gpt-4-turbo,"['inequality_solving_and_understanding', 'exponent_and_root_skills']",Consider the function $f(x) = 2^x + 2^{2-x}}$ and an inequality $f(x) < 5$ for real values of $x$. Find the difference between  the smallest and largest integer values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality.,"To solve this problem, let's first analyze the function and then solve the inequality $f(x) < 5$, where $f(x) = 2^x + 2^{2-x}$.

Let's simplify $f(x)$ to get a better intuition:
$$f(x) = 2^x + 2^{2-x} = 2^x + \frac{4}{2^x}.$$

We can let $u = 2^x$. Then, $2^{2-x} = 2^2 / 2^x = 4 / u$, and therefore:
$$f(x) = u + \frac{4}{u}, \text{ where } u = 2^x.$$

We need to find when $f(x) < 5$, i.e., when:
$$u + \frac{4}{u} < 5.$$

Let's rearrange and multiply by $u$ (assuming $u > 0$ which is true as $u = 2^x$ and $2^x$ is always positive):
$$u^2 - 5u + 4 < 0.$$

This is a quadratic inequality. We can factor it:
$$u^2 - 5u + 4 = (u - 4)(u - 1) < 0.$$

Using a sign analysis:
1. $(u - 4)(u - 1) = 0$ at $u = 1$ and $u = 4$.
2. The expression will be negative between these roots because signs in the product $(u - 4)(u - 1)$ change at the roots and the corresponding quadratic parabola opens upwards (positive leading coefficient).

Therefore, the inequality holds true when $1 < u < 4$.

Recall $u = 2^x$, so we want to find the range of $x$ such that:
$$1 < 2^x < 4.$$

Take logarithm base $2$ of the inequality:
$$\log_2(1) < x < \log_2(4),$$
which simplifies to:
$$0 < x < 2.$$

Finally, we find the integer values of $x$ that satisfy $0 < x < 2$. The integers in this interval are $1$ only. However, to find the difference between the largest and smallest integers that satisfy the inequality, consider only integer values that have a notable impact on the range. Since we evaluated the actual inequality range and verified it includes $x = 1$, the smallest and largest integers are both $1$. Hence, the difference $1 - 1 = 0$.

Therefore, the difference between the largest and smallest integer values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality $f(x) = 2^x + 2^{2-x} < 5$ is $\boxed{0}$."

Additionally, each card in the deck must have a unique positive integer number, starting from 1 up to $N$ inclusive. Once the deck is assembled, the mathematician will select one card at random. What is the number on the selected card that maximizes the sum of digits of this number? If there are multiple cards that maximize the sum of digits, what is the sum of the digits of the smallest such card?","First, find $N$ such that $\binom{N}{5}$ is divisible by 3 and 4 but not by 5. The formula for combinations is $\binom{N}{5} = \frac{N!}{5!(N-5)!}$. For this to be divisible by 3 and 4 but not by 5, we must look for an $N$ that gives a prime factorization of the combination containing 3 and 2 (to satisfy the divisibility by 3 and 4) but minimizing the effect of 5's in the factorization (since it shouldn't be divisible by 5).

The smallest such $N$ making the combination divisible by 12 (3 and 4's least common multiple) but not by 5 beyond the factor of $5! = 120$ is $N=10$. This gives $\binom{10}{5} = \frac{10!}{5!5!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 252$, which is divisible by 3 and 4 but not by 5 since the prime factorization of 252 is $2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7$, meeting the divisibility criteria.

Next, among the numbered cards from 1 to 10, the sum of digits is maximized for single-digit numbers by 9. However, for the two-digit numbers, 10 has a digit sum of 1, which does not compete with 9. Therefore, the card with the number maximizing the sum of digits is the card numbered 9.

The sum of the digits of the smallest card that maximizes the digit sum is simply the sum of the digits of 9, which is $9$. Thus, the answer, which is the sum of digits of the smallest card maximizing this sum, is $\boxed{9}$."

2. For $(0,3)$: $3 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c \Rightarrow 3 = c$

Substituting $3$ for $c$ in equations (1) and (3), we get:
1. $2 = a - b + 3$
2. $7 = 4a + 2b + 3$

Solving these equations simultaneously, we multiply the first by 2 and add it to the second to solve for $a$:
1. $4 + 7 = (2a - 2b + 6) + (4a + 2b + 3) \Rightarrow  2 = 6a$

\[M^3 = \begin{pmatrix} 16 & 21 \\ 28 & 37 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (16\cdot2 + 21\cdot4) & (16\cdot3 + 21\cdot5) \\ (28\cdot2 + 37\cdot4) & (28\cdot3 + 37\cdot5) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 104 & 147 \\ 188 & 265 \end{pmatrix}.\]

The probability that a student correctly answers at least one of each type of question involves calculating the probability of at least one success in each of the independent event categories (multiple-choice, true/false, numerical). 

1. Probability of correctly answering at least one multiple-choice question: Since there are 5 questions and each has a 0.6 success rate, the probability of failing all of them is $(1-0.6)^5 = 0.4^5$. Thus, the probability of answering at least one correctly is $1 - 0.4^5$.

2. The calculation for true or false questions is the same as for multiple-choice due to the same success rate and number of questions: $1 - 0.4^5$.

3. The numerical-answer questions also have the same calculation for at least one correct answer: $1 - 0.4^5$.

Since these events are independent, their combined probability of success is the product of the individual probabilities: 
\[ \left(1 - 0.4^5\right) \times \left(1 - 0.4^5\right) \times \left(1 - 0.4^5\right) = \left(1 - 0.4^5\right)^3 \]

\[V_{large} = \frac{(2\sqrt{2})^3\sqrt{2}}{12} = \frac{16 * 2}}{12} = \frac{8}{3}.\]
Next, the edge length of the smaller tetrahedron is half of the larger one, making it $a = \sqrt{2}$. The volume of the smaller tetrahedron is therefore  
\[V_{small} = \frac{(\sqrt{2})^3\sqrt{2}}{12} = \frac{2 * 2}{12} = \frac{1}{3}.\]
To find the combined volume, we add the volumes of the two tetrahedrons:
\[V_{combined} = V_{large} + V_{small} = \frac{8}{3} + \frac{1}{3}.\]
Simplifying further gives  
\[V_{combined} = \frac{9}{3} = 3.\]
Rounding to the nearest integer, we get $\boxed{3}$ as the combined volume of both tetrahedrons. 

This solution step-by-step demonstrated the necessity of three-dimensional geometry skills for applying the volume formula to a tetrahedron and calculation and conversion skills for managing the arithmetic operations, including manipulating square roots and fractions, as well as the rounding to a whole number at the end."

The radius of the garden is equal to the largest prime factor of the sum $11^2 + 60^2$. What is the area of the circular garden, rounded down to the nearest integer?","To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the circular garden based on the largest prime factor of \(11^2 + 60^2\), then use this radius to calculate the area of the garden. First, we calculate \(11^2 + 60^2\). We find \(11^2 = 121\) and \(60^2 = 3600\), so \(11^2 + 60^2 = 121 + 3600 = 3721\). Next, we find the prime factors of \(3721\). Notice that \(3721 = 61^2\), so the only prime factor of \(3721\) is \(61\). Therefore, the radius \(r\) of the garden is \(61\). The area \(A\) of a circle with radius \(r\) is given by \(A = \pi r^2\). Substituting \(r = 61\), we have \(A = \pi \times 61^2 = \pi \times 3721\). Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14159\), we find \(A \approx 3.14159 \times 3721 \approx 11688.09039\). Rounding down to the nearest integer, we get \(A \approx 11,689.85639\).

1. The integer is divisible by 5.
2. When divided by 4, it leaves a remainder of 3.

Let’s denote the integer by \( N \).

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Set up the conditions
Since \( N \) is divisible by 5, we can write:
\[
N = 5k
\]
for some integer \( k \).

Also, since \( N \) leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, we have:
\[
N \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
\]

#### Step 2: Substitute and simplify
Substitute \( N = 5k \) into the second condition:
\[
5k \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
\]

Since \( 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), we can simplify this to:
\[
k \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
\]

This tells us that \( k \) must be of the form:
\[
k = 4m + 3
\]
for some integer \( m \).

#### Step 3: Substitute back to find \( N \)
Now substitute \( k = 4m + 3 \) into \( N = 5k \):
\[
N = 5(4m + 3) = 20m + 15
\]

Thus, \( N \) can be written as:
\[
N = 20m + 15
\]

#### Step 4: Determine the range of \( m \)
Since \( N \) is a three-digit integer, we need:
\[
100 \leq N \leq 999
\]

Substituting \( N = 20m + 15 \) gives:
\[
100 \leq 20m + 15 \leq 999
\]

##### Solve for the lower bound
\[
100 \leq 20m + 15
\]
\[
85 \leq 20m
\]
\[
m \geq 4.25
\]
Since \( m \) must be an integer, we start with \( m = 5 \) for the lower bound.

##### Solve for the upper bound
\[
20m + 15 \leq 999
\]
\[
20m \leq 984
\]
\[
m \leq 49.2
\]
So the largest integer \( m \) can take is \( m = 49 \).

#### Step 5: Count the possible values of \( m \)
The integer values for \( m \) range from \( m = 5 \) to \( m = 49 \).

The total number of values for \( m \) is:
\[
49 - 5 + 1 = 45
\]

### Final Answer
There are \( \boxed{45} \) three-digit positive integers that satisfy both conditions."

If the garden's perimeter is 60 meters, on which day will the total number of seeds planted exceed the area of the garden?","Firstly, let's solve for the dimensions of the garden. If we let the width be $w$ meters, then the length must be $2w$ meters because the length is twice the width. The perimeter ($P$) of a rectangle is given by $P = 2l + 2w$, which means in this case, $60 = 2(2w) + 2w = 6w$. Solving this equation for $w$ gives us $w = 10$ meters, and hence, the length $l = 2 \times 10 = 20$ meters. Therefore, the area of the garden is $l \times w = 20 \times 10 = 200$ square meters.

Next, we need to calculate on which day the total number of seeds planted exceeds the area of the garden. The sequence of seeds planted forms an arithmetic series where the first term, $a_1 = 1$, and the common difference, $d = 2$. The sum of the first $n$ terms of this arithmetic series is given by $S_n = \frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n-1)d]$, which simplifies to $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(2 + (n-1)2) = \frac{n}{2}(2n)=n^2$. We are seeking the smallest integer $n$ for which $S_n > 200$. Thus, we need to solve the inequality $n^2 > 200$.

Solving the inequality, we find:

\[n^2 > 200\]

Taking the square root of both sides gives us $n > \sqrt{200}$. Since $\sqrt{200}$ is approximately equal to $14.14$, the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality is $15$. 

Hence, on the $\boxed{15th}$ day, the total number of seeds planted will exceed the area of the garden, requiring expertise in both solving linear equations to find the garden's dimensions and factoring skills to calculate the sum of an arithmetic series and solve the resulting inequality."

If you have $\$30$, how many soda cans can you purchase if you want to maximize the number of cans bought under this offer?","Let x be the initial number of cans you take to the counter

The original cost of x cans is: 0.75x
1.5 times that original cost is: 1.5(0.75x) = 1.125x
This $1.125x must equal your $30 budget
So the equation is: 1.125x = 30
We can solve this equation for x to determine the initial number of cans. Then doubling that will give the maximum number of cans you can get under this offer.

Solving for $x$ we obtain $26.67$. The number of cans has to be integer, so we get $x =26$, which according to our equation will cost $1.125 \times 26 =29.25$ dollars for receiving $2 \times 26 =52$ cans. However, this leaves over $0.75$, which can be used to buy one more can, for a total of 53 cans.

To find the roots of the polynomial, we notice that it might not be straightforward to factorize directly. However, by inspection or by trying integer values, we can check if $1$ or $-1$ is a root. Substituting $z = 1$, we get $P(1) = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0$. So, $z = 1$ is indeed a root.

We have discovered that $x = 1$ is a root of the polynomial, but we are specifically asked for a root with $b \neq 0$, so we factor $P(z)$ into $P(z) = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 2)$. Then by the quadratic formula, $a = -1/2$.

Next, we substitute $a = 1$ into the expression $a^2 + 4a + 4$. This substitution and simplification is a clear example of algebraic manipulation skills.

The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$. Hence, the sum of the roots for our equation is $-\frac{-2}{1} = 2$. Therefore, $a = 2$.

For the common ratio $r$, we need to solve the equation $9^{y} = 81$. Since $81 = 9^2$, it follows that $y = 2$, and thus, $r = \sqrt{2}$.

Now, using the formula for the sum of the first four terms of a geometric sequence, $S_4 = \frac{a(1-r^4)}{1-r}$ where $a = 2$ and $r = \sqrt{2}$, we can substitute these values into the formula to get:
$$S_4 = \frac{2(1-(\sqrt{2})^4)}{1-\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2(1-4)}{1-\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2(-3)}{1-\sqrt{2}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt{2} - 1} = 6(\sqrt{2} + 1).$$

Since $\left\lfloor 6\sqrt{2} + 6 \right\rfloor$ means taking the floor of $6\sqrt{2}$, and knowing that $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$, we find $6\sqrt{2} \approx 8.484$. Taking the floor value gives $\left\lfloor 6\sqrt{2} + 6 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 14.484 \right\rfloor = 14$.

Given the total weight of these ingredients per cake is 15 kg, we can divide this total into the ratio, i.e., each part equals to $15 kg / 5 = 3 kg$. Therefore, for one cake, flour required is $2*3=6$ kg, sugar is $3$ kg, and eggs are $2*3=6$ kg.

Given the quantities of ingredients available: 40 kg of flour, 10 kg of sugar, and 20 kg of eggs, we find out how many cakes each ingredient can make individually.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Find the length of the path (altitude of the original triangle):
   - We know that the original triangle is a right-angled triangle with sides 60 feet, 80 feet, and 100 feet.
   - The longest side (100 feet) is the hypotenuse, and the right angle is opposite the shortest side (60 feet).
   - Using the formula for the area of a triangle: $Area = \frac{1}{2} \times base \times height$
   - $\frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times height = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \times 80$
   - $100 \times height = 60 \times 80$
   - $height = \frac{60 \times 80}{100} = 48$ feet

2. Calculate the number of lights needed:
   - The lights are placed 5 feet apart along the 48-foot path.
   - Number of lights = $\frac{48}{5} + 1 = 9.6 + 1 = 10.6$, rounded down to 10 lights

3. Calculate the areas of the two smaller triangles:
   - The sum of the area of two smaller right-angled triangles is the area of the original triangle.
   - $Area = \frac{1}{2} \times base \times height = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \times 80 = 2400$ sq feet

4. Report the total cost:

Given that the length is 9 feet more than twice the width, we can write this relationship as $l = 2w + 9$.

From the Pythagorean theorem, we know that the square of the length of the diagonal is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, or $d^2 = w^2 + l^2$. Given that the diagonal measures $\sqrt{113}$ feet, we can substitute into this equation to get $113 = w^2 + (2w+9)^2$.

Expanding the right side of the equation gives $113 = w^2 + 4w^2 + 36w + 81$. Simplifying this gives $113 = 5w^2 + 36w + 81$.

Subtracting 113 from both sides gives $0 = 5w^2 + 36w - 32$. Dividing through by 5 gives $0 = w^2 + \frac{36}{5}w - \frac{32}{5}$.

Solving this quadratic equation for $w$ (using either factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula), we find that $w = \frac{4}{5}$. Substitute $w = \frac{4}{5}$ into the equation $l = 2w + 9$ to find that $l = \frac{53}{5}$.

So, the perimeter of the plot is $2l + 2w = 2(\frac{53}{5}) + 2(\frac{4}{5}) = \frac{114}{5}$ feet. Given that the cost of the fencing is $15$ dollars per foot, the total cost of the fencing is $15 \times \frac{114}{5} = 342$ dollars."

What is the smallest width (in cm) the original rectangular sheet can have?","First, we use ""arithmetic_operations"" to find out the total area needed for at least 300 square pieces of 2 cm each. Since the area of each square piece is $2\text{ cm} \times 2\text{ cm} = 4\text{ cm}^2$, the total area needed for at least 300 pieces is $300 \times 4 = 1200\text{ cm}^2$.

Next, let's denote the width of the rectangular sheet by $w$ (in cm). Then, its length would be $w + 14$ (since it is 14 cm longer than its width), and the area of the rectangular sheet can be represented as $w(w + 14)$. For the teacher to have at least 300 square pieces, the area of the rectangular sheet must be at least 1200 cm^2. Thus, we have:
\[ w(w + 14) \geq 1200 \]

Moving to the ""solving_linear_equation"" skill to solve this quadratic inequality, we expand it and rearrange terms:
\[ w^2 + 14w - 1200 \geq 0 \]
\[ w^2 + 14w - 1200 = 0 \] to find critical points.

Solving this quadratic equation (either through factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula), we find that the roots are $w = 28.34$ and $w = -42.34$. Since width cannot be negative we ignore the negative solution. 

Thus $w = 28.34$ cm satisfies the inequality. Then the length is $28.34 + 14 = 42.34$. However the original requirement requires cutting into squares with each side 2cm, so the effective dimensions become $28 \times 42$, which would not satisfy the desired inequality. Hence we must round up to the next even number to obtain smallest positive width that allows for at least 300 square pieces of 2 cm each to be cut out after considering the condition that the length is 14 cm longer than its width.

     5x = 1428
   * Solve for x:
     x = 1428 / 5
     x = 285.6
   * Rounding to the nearest whole number:
     Water needed ≈ 286 grams

2. Finding the maximum number of dough pieces:
   * Total weight of the dough = Water + Flour
     Total weight = 286 + 714 = 1000 grams
   * The baker divides the dough into pieces, each weighing at least 45 grams, except for the last piece.
   * Let’s first subtract the weight of the last piece
     1000 - 23 = 977
   * Let’s find the maximum number of 45-gram pieces that can be made from 977 grams:
     977 ÷ 45 ≈ 21.71
   * Since we can’t have a fractional number of pieces, the baker can make at most 21 pieces weighing atleast 45 grams each, since the dough corresponding to the 0.71 of a piece could be redistributed (in an arbitrary) by adding it to the 21 pieces of 45gms each)
   * Therefore, the maximum number of pieces the baker ended up with is 21 + 1 = 22 pieces.

In summary, the baker should use 286 grams of water, and the maximum number of pieces of dough the baker ended up with is \boxed{22}."

The 12th roots of unity are given by $z_k = e^{2\pi i k/12}$ for $k=0, 1, ..., 11$. Each root can be expressed in the form $z_k = \cos(2\pi k/12) + i\sin(2\pi k/12)$.

To satisfy $\Re(z) + 2\Im(z) \in \mathbb{Z}$, we substitute $\Re(z) = \cos(2\pi k/12)$ and $\Im(z) = \sin(2\pi k/12)$ into the equation and get $\cos(2\pi k/12) + 2\sin(2\pi k/12) \in \mathbb{Z}$. 

We need to check each of the 12 roots to see which satisfy this condition:
- For $k=0$, we have $\Re(z) + 2\Im(z) = 1 + 0 = 1$, which is an integer.
- For $k=3$, we have $\Re(z) + 2\Im(z) = 0 + 2(1) = 2$, which is an integer.
- For $k=6$, we have $\Re(z) + 2\Im(z) = -1 + 0 = -1$, which is an integer.
- For $k=9$, we have $\Re(z) + 2\Im(z) = 0 - 2 = -2$, which is an integer.

For other values of $k$, $\sin(2\pi k/12)$ and $\cos(2\pi k/12)$ will either produce fractions or the sum will not result in an integer due to the presence of $\sqrt{3}/2$, $\sqrt{2}/2$, or similar terms within their trigonometric definitions.

Therefore, there are $\boxed{4}$ complex numbers $z$ such that $z^{12} = 1$ and $\Re(z) + 2\Im(z)$ is an integer.

1. **Identifying Square-Free Numbers (Prime Number Theory)**: A square-free number is a number not divisible by any square except 1. Square-free numbers up to a small limit can be identified by excluding numbers divisible by squares of prime numbers. For example, the first few square-free numbers greater than 1 are 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, etc. (excluding 4, 8, 9, 12 since these are divisible by the squares of 2 and 3).
   
2. **Selecting a Number That Can Be Divided into 3 Piles (Number Manipulation)**: Consistent with the puzzle, we are looking for a number that can be divided into exactly 3 distinct piles, each with a prime number of coins.  
   

3. **Combining Skills to Find the Smallest Number**: We check various numbers. The smallest primes are $2, 3, 5$ and their sum is  $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$ which is square-free.

Express your answer  rounded up  to the ceiling of the actual answer.,"First, let's use the given information about the cuboid volume and area to find its dimensions. The volume of the cuboid is given as $v=8^3=512$ cubic units, and the area of the base is $a = 8 \cdot 16 = 128$ square units. Since the volume of a cuboid is the product of its length ($l$), width ($w$), and height ($h$), and given that the area of the base (which is the product of length and width) equals 128 square units, we can start by setting up the relationships:
\[v = l \cdot w \cdot h = 512\]
\[a = l \cdot w = 128.\]

Thus $h = 512/128 =4$ units. 

The length of the diagonal  $d$ of the cuboid is $\sqrt{w^2 + l^2 + h^2}$ by the  3-dimensional Pythagorean theorem. Since $h$ is known, the minimum length is obtained by minimizing $w^2 + l^2$ subject to $l \cdot w = 128$. The minimum is attained when $w =l = \sqrt{128}$. 

 Thus the minimum diagonal is 
\[d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = \sqrt{2 \times 128 + 4^2} = \sqrt{256 + 16} = \sqrt{272}.\]

Since $272$ lies between $16^2 =256$ and $17^2 =289$ the length of the diagonal rounded up to the ceiling is $17$ units.

The answer is $\boxed{17}$ units. 

Thus, both vector operations skill and exponential/logarithmic reasoning were crucial for solving this problem."

If the first drone starts at $t=0$ and each subsequent drone starts 2 minutes after the previous one, calculate the time difference in minutes between the first and the last drone to arrive at the retailer location, when all toys have been delivered. Assume there is an unlimited number of drones available and each drone travels directly to the retailer without any stops.","First, we need to calculate how many drones are required to deliver all toys. Each drone can carry 12 toys, and there are a total of 360 toys. Thus, we divide the total number of toys by the capacity of each drone: $360 / 12 = 30$. This means 30 drones are required.

Next, we recognize that the drones fly at constant velocity, since the displacement per second is constant. 

Since the first drone starts at $t=0$ and each subsequent drone starts 2 minutes after the previous one, the start time for each drone increases linearly. Given that there are 30 drones, the starting time of the last drone is $2 \times (30 - 1) = 58$ minutes after the first drone.

Therefore, the time difference in minutes between the first and the last drone to arrive at the retailer location, when all toys have been delivered, is $\boxed{58}$ minutes. 

The calculation is straightforward and does not require detailed analysis of the parametric equations given for the drones' paths since all drones travel the same linear path but start at different times.

For $a_4$: $a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2 + 2^4 = 2*15 - 5 + 16 = 41$.

A rectangular plot within the garden, oriented such that its sides are parallel to the garden's axes, needs to be fenced. If the rectangular plot has the maximum possible area that can fit within the ellipse, calculate the length of the fencing material required, in meters.","To solve this problem using the Lagrange multiplier method, we need to set up the objective function (the area of the rectangle) and the constraint equation (the ellipse equation). Let's define the variables:

Let the rectangle have dimensions 2x and 2y, so that the center of the rectangle coincides with the center of the ellipse.

Objective function (area of the rectangle):
A(x, y) = (2x)(2y) = 4xy

Constraint equation (ellipse equation):
(x^2 / a^2) + (y^2 / b^2) = 1, where a = 5 and b = 4 (half of the major and minor axes)

Step 1: Set up the Lagrangian function:
L(x, y, λ) = 4xy - λ((x^2 / 25) + (y^2 / 16) - 1)

Step 2: Find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, and λ:
∂L/∂x = 4y - (2λx / 25) = 0
∂L/∂y = 4x - (2λy / 16) = 0
∂L/∂λ = (x^2 / 25) + (y^2 / 16) - 1 = 0

Step 3: Solve the system of equations:
From ∂L/∂x: 4y = (2λx / 25)
From ∂L/∂y: 4x = (2λy / 16)

Multiply both sides of the equations:
(4y) * (4x) = (2λx / 25) * (2λy / 16)
16xy = 4λ^2xy / 400

Divide both sides of the equations by xy:
16 = 4λ^2 / 400
16 * 400 = 4λ^2
6400 / 4 = λ^2
1600 = λ^2

We take the positive root λ = 40. We substitute this value into the system of linear equations:
4y = (2* 40 * x / 25)
y = 4x / 5

We substitute this into the constraint:
(x^2/25) + ((4x / 5)^2 / 16) = 1
(x^2/25) + (16x^2 / 400) = 1
(x^2/25) + (x^2 / 25) = 1
(2x^2 / 25) = 1
2x^2 = 25
x^2 = 25 / 2

We take the positive root x = 5 * sqrt(1/2) and substitute this value in the system of linear equations:
y = 4 * 5 * sqrt(1/2) / 5
y = 4 * sqrt(1/2)

Step 4: Calculate the dimensions of the rectangle and the length of the fencing material:
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
2x = 10 * sqrt(1/2)
2y = 8 * sqrt(1/2)

The length of the fencing material is the perimeter of the rectangle:
Perimeter = 2(2x) + 2(2y)
= 2 * (10 * sqrt(2/2) + 8 * sqrt(1/2))
= 36 * sqrt(1/2) meters

Therefore, the length of the fencing material required is 18 * √(1/2) meters (approximately 25.45 meters)."

First, participants are asked to construct a triangle given its sides as 9 cm, 40 cm, and 41 cm. Next, assuming each participant makes a unique error in measuring each side, resulting in each side either being 1 cm too long or 1 cm too short, how many distinct triangles, none congruent to the original or to each other, can the participants end up constructing?","First, we examine the original triangle with sides 9 cm, 40 cm, and 41 cm. It’s worth noting that these lengths satisfy the Pythagorean theorem ($9^2 + 40^2 = 41^2$), indicating that the original triangle is a right triangle.

Each side can either increase or decrease by 1 cm due to measurement errors, leading to 2 choices (either +1 or -1 cm) per side, and since there are 3 sides, there are a total of $2^3 = 8$ potential ways to modify the side lengths.

These combinations are:
1. (8 cm, 39 cm, 40 cm)
2. (8 cm, 39 cm, 42 cm)
3. (8 cm, 41 cm, 40 cm)
4. (8 cm, 41 cm, 42 cm)
5. (10 cm, 39 cm, 40 cm)
6. (10 cm, 39 cm, 42 cm)
7. (10 cm, 41 cm, 40 cm)
8. (10 cm, 41 cm, 42 cm)

For each of these combinations, we need to apply the triangle inequality theorem to ensure they can form a triangle:
- (8 cm, 39 cm, 40 cm) does satisfy the theorem.
- (8 cm, 39 cm, 42 cm) does satisfy the theorem.
- (8 cm, 41 cm, 40 cm) does satisfy the theorem.
- (8 cm, 41 cm, 42 cm) does satisfy the theorem.
- (10 cm, 39 cm, 40 cm) does satisfy the theorem.
- (10 cm, 39 cm, 42 cm) does satisfy the theorem.
- (10 cm, 41 cm, 40 cm) does satisfy the theorem.
- (10 cm, 41 cm, 42 cm) does satisfy the theorem.

Thus, out of the 8 potential combinations, all 8 combinations satisfy the triangle inequality theorem and can form triangles. Furthermore, none of these combinations are congruent to the original triangle, nor with each other.

Therefore, the number of distinct, non-congruent triangles that can be constructed due to measurement errors is $\boxed{8}$. 

This solution showcases the need for both triangle geometry skills (to verify valid triangles through the triangle inequality theorem and recognize congruence) and counting and number theory (to enumerate all combinations while avoiding overcounting or counting invalid options)."

If the classroom has $\$3$, what is the maximum number of guests (each with a unique prime number code) they can invite based on the constraint and their budget?","Firstly, we identify the prime numbers between 50 and 150. Without listing each prime number calculation, prime numbers in this range are $53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139,$ and $149$. This makes a total of $20$ prime numbers.

Here, number theory and arithmetic operations skills were utilized to understand and enumerate the prime numbers within the specified range. Identifying primes is a fundamental application of number theory.

Next, we calculate how many cards can be purchased. Each card costs $5$ cents, and the classroom has $\$3$, which is equivalent to $300$ cents.

The cost for $n$ cards is given by $5n$ cents. Since $300$ cents are available, we solve the inequality $5n \le 300$. Dividing both sides by $5$ gives us $n \le 60$.

However, since there are only $20$ primes (and hence only $20$ guests can be invited), the relevant comparison is with the number of available primes rather than the total afforded based on the budget. Therefore, determining how many guests can be invited is constrained by the number of prime numbers identified.

To see if $20$ cards can be afforded: $20$ cards at $5$ cents per card cost $20 \cdot 5 = 100$ cents, or $\$1$. Since $\$1$ is less than the available $\$3$, and since there are $20$ prime numbers available for use as codes, the classroom can invite a maximum of $\boxed{20}$ guests based on their budget and the requirement for unique prime number codes. 

Here, the multiplication and division skill was used to calculate the cost of purchasing a certain number of cards and ensuring that cost does not exceed the budget. This demonstrates the separate and essential use of both skills in solving this problem."

After building the path, a square sandpit with the highest possible whole number side length is built inside the remaining central rectangular lawn area. What is the side length of the square sandpit?","First, let's determine the width of the path. The area of the rectangular garden is 24 feet * 36 feet = 864 square feet. If the path covers a total area of 160 square feet, then the area of the remaining garden (inside the path) is 864 square feet - 160 square feet = 704 square feet. 

Let's say the width of the path is x feet. The dimensions of the remaining garden would be (24-2x) feet and (36-2x) feet. Thus, the area of the remaining garden is also equal to (24-2x) feet * (36-2x) feet = 704 square feet. 

Solving this equation will give us the width of the path:

(24 - 2x)(36 - 2x) = 704
864 - 48x - 72x + 4x^2 = 704
4x^2 - 120x + 864 = 704
4x^2 - 120x + 160 = 0
x^2 - 30x + 40 = 0

To solve this equation, we will use the quadratic formula, which is:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

where:
a = 1 (the coefficient of x²)
b = -30 (the coefficient of x)
c = 40 (the constant)

Substituting these values into the quadratic formula gives:

x = [30 ± sqrt((-30)² - 4*1*40)] / (2*1)
x = [30 ± sqrt(900 - 160)] / 2
x = [30 ± sqrt(740)] / 2
x = [30 ± sqrt(4*185)] / 2
x = [30 ± 2*sqrt(185)] / 2
x = 15 ± sqrt(185)

The two possible values for x are approximately 15 - 13.6 = 1.4 feet and 15 + 13.6 = 28.6 feet. However, the width of the path cannot be more than half the smallest dimension of the garden, so the path's width is approximately x = 1.4 feet.

Now, for the square sandpit. The dimensions of the remaining garden after the path is built are 24 - 2*1.4 = 21.2 feet and 36 - 2*1.4 = 33.2 feet. The side length of the square sandpit must be the smaller of these two dimensions, so the side length of the sandpit is approximately 21.2 feet. However, if we want the highest possible whole number for the side length, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. So the side length of the sandpit is 21 feet."

The volume of a cylinder is given by $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. We are given that $V = 729\pi$. Therefore: $729\pi = \pi r^2 (3r)$
$729\pi = 3\pi r^3$
$243 = r^3$
The radius of the base of the cylinder is $r = 3\sqrt[3]{9}$ units. Then, the height of the cylinder is $3r = 3(3\sqrt[3]{9}) = 9\sqrt[3]{9}$ units.

The total length of the fencing originally enclosing the half that is getting reshaped is its two widths and lengths: $2 * (20 + 30) = 100$ feet. When reshaped into a square, each side of the square would be $\frac{100}{4} = 25$ feet because a square has all sides of equal length. Thus, the area of the new square vegetable garden is $25^2 = 625 \text{ square feet}$.

The total length of the fencing used to enclose this square garden is still 100 feet as it was merely reshaped, not extended or reduced. Thus, the square of the length of the fencing is $100^2 = 10000 \text{ square feet}$.

At the end of your calculation, round off the length to the nearest integer.","To find the total length of the cable, we first note that the helix makes a full turn every 2 meters of vertical ascension. Since the cylinder has a height of 10 meters, the cable makes 10/2 = 5 full turns around the cylinder. Each turn of the helix can be viewed as wrapping around the circumference of the cylinder while also ascending 2 meters upward. 

Because the helix makes a full 360-degree turn for every 2 meters of vertical rise, each section of the helix's path (per full turn) is part of a right-angled triangle where:
- The base of the triangle (adjacent side) is the circumference of the cylinder (2πr, with r being the radius of the cylinder, which is 1 meter). Thus, the base is 2π meters.
- The height of the triangle (opposite side) is the vertical rise per turn, which is 2 meters.
- The hypotenuse of the triangle is the length of the cable for that section of the helix.

The length of one full turn of the helix (the hypotenuse of the triangle) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: \(L = \sqrt{(2π)^2 + 2^2}\).

Substituting the known values gives: \(L = \sqrt{4π^2 + 4}\).

Since the cable makes 5 full turns around the cylinder, the total length of the cable is: \(Total Length = 5 \times \sqrt{4π^2 + 4}\).

Evaluating the expression gives the total length as approximately 32.97 meters.

The vertex form of a parabola is $f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola. The inequality $f(x) \geq 0$ implies we are interested in where this parabola lies above the x-axis within the interval [$-5, 10$].

For $f(x)$ to be greater than or equal to 0 over the entire interval, the vertex must lie within or above the x-axis, and any roots (if they exist) must lie outside of the interval [$-5, 10$].

Next, we find the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$ for the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c$. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=-n$, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is $\frac{n}{2}$. 

We want the vertex to be at the lowest point within or above the x-axis over [$-5, 10$]. At the boundaries, $f(-5) = 25 + 5n + 240$ and $f(10) = 100 - 10n + 240$. These should both be greater than or equal to 0.

1. For $x = -5$, $f(x) = 25 + 5n + 240 \geq 0$ is always true for all $n$, as the expression simplifies to $265 + 5n$, which is positive for all $n$.

2. For $x = 10$, $f(x) = 100 - 10n + 240 \geq 0$ leads to $340 - 10n \geq 0$, solving for $n$ gives $n \leq 34$.

Since we're looking for the largest integer $n$ satisfying these conditions, and considering the parabola opens upwards (meaning for $f(x)$ to be non-negative in the given interval would require the vertex not to produce negative values when $x$ is within [$-5, 10$]), we conclude that the largest integer value of $n$ is $34$ as it meets the requirement that $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $-5 \leq x \leq 10$.

Therefore, the largest integer for $n$ is $\boxed{34}$."

If the side length of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ is $12$, calculate the magnitude of the vector $\mathbf{AP} + \mathbf{BP} + \mathbf{CP}$.","In an equilateral triangle, the height is given by $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a$, where $a$ is the side length. With a side length of 12, the height is $6\sqrt{3}$. The total area of the equilateral triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 \cdot 6\sqrt{3} = 36\sqrt{3}$. The areas of the three triangles are in the ratio 3:4:5, so they are $\frac{3}{12} \cdot 36\sqrt{3} = 9\sqrt{3}$, $\frac{4}{12} \cdot 36\sqrt{3} = 12\sqrt{3}$, and $\frac{5}{12} \cdot 36\sqrt{3} = 15\sqrt{3}$ respectively.

Now let's set up a coordinate system with $B$ as the origin $(0,0)$, $A$ at $(6, 6\sqrt{3})$, and $C$ at $(12,0)$. Let the coordinates of $P$ be $(x, y)$. The area of triangle $PBC$ is $12\sqrt{3}$. Its base is 12 and its height is $y$. The area formula gives: $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 \cdot y = 12\sqrt{3}$. So $y = 2\sqrt{3}$.

To find $x$, we can use the cross product of $\vec{PB}$ and $\vec{AB}$. The magnitude of this cross product is equal to 2 times the area of triangle $PAB$, which is $18\sqrt{3}$.

$\vec{PB} \times \vec{AB} = 18\sqrt{3}$
$(x, y) \times (6, 6\sqrt{3}) = 18\sqrt{3}$
$x \cdot 6\sqrt{3} - y \cdot 6 = 18\sqrt{3}$
$x \cdot 6\sqrt{3} - 2\sqrt{3} \cdot 6 = 18\sqrt{3}$
$x \cdot 6\sqrt{3} - 12\sqrt{3} = 18\sqrt{3}$
$x \cdot 6\sqrt{3} = 30\sqrt{3}$
$x = 5$

So the coordinates of $P$ are $(5, 2\sqrt{3})$.

Now, $\vec{AP} + \vec{BP} + \vec{CP} = \vec{BP} - \vec{BA} + \vec{BP} + \vec{BP} - \vec{BC} = 3 \vec{BP} - \vec{BA} - \vec{BC} = (15, 6\sqrt{3}) - (6, 6\sqrt{3}) - (12, 0) = (-3, 0)$.

We take the derivative with respect to $n$ and set it to zero to find critical points:

f'(n) = \frac{d}{dn}\left(\frac{n^2}{2^n}\right) = \frac{2n \cdot 2^n - n^2 \cdot 2^n \cdot \ln(2)}{2^{2n}}

\[
2n = n^2 \ln(2) \Rightarrow n\ln(2) = 2 \Rightarrow n = \frac{2}{\ln(2)} and n != 0

Since $n$ must be an integer, we test integers around $\frac{2}{\ln(2)} \approx 2.885$. Checking $n = 3$ and $n = 4$ in the original function $a_n$:

- For $n = 3$: $a_3 = \frac{9}{8} > 1$
- For $n = 4$: $a_4 = \frac{16}{16} = 1$

Find the value of $n$.","Given the equation $x^2 - (n-2)x - n = 0$, the sum of the solutions, according to Vieta's formulas, is $S = n-2$.

The problem states that $n \cdot S = 399$ and that $S$ is a prime number. Substituting $S = n - 2$ into the equation, we get

",What is the sum of the first 4 terms of a geometric sequence whose first term is the greatest prime factor of $18!$ and whose common ratio is the reciprocal of the fraction representation of $.\overline{3}$?,"First, we identify the greatest prime factor of $18!$. The prime factors of $18!$ are all the prime numbers up to 18. The greatest prime number less than or equal to 18 is 17. Therefore, the greatest prime factor of $18!$ is $17$. This showcases the basic arithmetic skill - identifying prime numbers and understanding factorials.

Next, we find the reciprocal of the fraction representation of $.\overline{3}$. We can either remember that $.\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3}$, or derive this by setting $x = .\overline{3}$, leading to $10x = 3.\overline{3}$, subtracting $x$ from $10x$ to find $9x = 3$, and thus $x = \frac{1}{3}$. The reciprocal of $\frac{1}{3}$ is $3$. This part of the solution utilizes the basic arithmetic skill again, specifically in converting repeating decimals to fractions and finding reciprocals.

Given that the first term ($a_1$) of our geometric sequence is $17$ (the greatest prime factor of $18!$) and the common ratio ($r$) is $3$ (the reciprocal of $.\overline{3}$), we can find the sum of the first 4 terms of this geometric sequence using the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence: $S_n = a_1 \frac{(1-r^n)}{1-r}$ for $r \neq 1$.

For $n = 4$, $a_1 = 17$, and $r = 3$, the sum is:
$S_4 = 17 \times \frac{(1-3^4)}{1-3} = 17 \times \frac{(1-81)}{-2} = 17 \times \frac{-80}{-2} = 17 \times 40 = 680$.

The sum of the first 4 terms of this geometric sequence is $\boxed{680}$.

Given that the equation of a logarithmic spiral can be expressed as $r = ae^{b\theta}$, where $r$ is the distance from the origin, $\theta$ is the angle in radians, and $a$ and $b$ are constants, find the value of $b$, rounded to the nearest integer.","First, we transform the point $(4,0)$ in polar coordinates. This point has $r = 4$ and $\theta = \arctan(0/4) = \arctan(0) = 0$.

Substituting these values into the equation of the logarithmic spiral $r = ae^{b\theta}$, we get $4 = a$.

Next, we find where the hypotenus intersects with the line that forms an angle of $45^\circ$ with the horizontal axis.

The hypotenuse of the triangle can be represented by the equation $y = -\frac{3}{4}x + 3$. 

The line that forms an angle of $45^\circ$ with the horizontal axis is represented by the equation $y = x$. 

Setting these two equations equal to each other gives:

$-\frac{3}{4}x + 3 = x$

Solving this equation for $x$ gives $x = \frac{12}{7}$. Substituting $x = \frac{12}{7}$ into the equation $y = x$ gives $y = \frac{12}{7}$. Therefore, the point at which the spiral intersects the hypotenuse is $(\frac{12}{7}, \frac{12}{7})$.

In polar coordinates, this point has $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{12}{7}$ and $\theta = \arctan(y/x) = \arctan(1) = \pi/4$.

Substituting these values into the equation of the logarithmic spiral $r = ae^{b\theta}$, we get $\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{12}{7} = 4 \cdot e^{b\pi/4}$.

After simplication, $\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{3}{7} = e^{b\pi/4}$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives $\ln(\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{3}{7}) = b\pi/4$. Solving for $b$ gives $b = 4\ln(\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{3}{7})/\pi \approx -0.63$.

Assume an initial investment of $10000.","First, convert the annual interest rate of 8% to a decimal: \(r = 0.08\). 

For compounding monthly for 6 months (\(n = 12\) since it’s compounded monthly and \(t = \frac{1}{2}\) year), use the formula: 
\[A_m = 10000 \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{12}\right)^{(12 \times \frac{1}{2})} = 10000 \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{12}\right)^6\]

Solving inside the parentheses: 
\[1 + \frac{0.08}{12} = 1 + 0.00666666667 = 1.00666666667\]

Raise to the 6th power: 
\[1.00666666667^6 \approx 1.040604\]

Then multiply by the principal: 
\[A_m = 10000 \times 1.040604 \approx 10406.04\]

For compounding annually for 6 months (\(n = 1\), \(t = \frac{1}{2}\)), 
\[A_a = 10000(1+0.08)^{\frac{1}{2}}\]

When calculating the amount for annual compounding, note that \(1+0.08 = 1.08\), and we need to take the square root because of the exponent \(\frac{1}{2}\), which gives
\[A_a = 10000 \times 1.08^{\frac{1}{2}} \approx 10000 \times 1.03923 \approx 10392.3\]

The first six non-trivial factors (excluding 1 and 720 itself) would be the smallest factors after 1, which are 2, 3, 4 (which is \(2^2\)), 5, 6 (which is \(2 \times 3\)), and 8 (which is \(2^3\)). 

Adding these factors together gives us the sum \(2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 = 28\).

This sum, 28, is given as the total circumference of a circle \(C = 28\).

Now, applying the knowledge of circles, we use the formula for the circumference of a circle \(C = 2\pi r\), where \(C = 28\). We can solve for \(r\) as follows:

\[28 = 2\pi r\]

\[r = 14/\pi\]

As the question requests the answer to be expressed as a whole number, and knowing that \(\pi\) is approximately 3.14, we calculate the radius as follows:

Rounding to the nearest whole number, \(r\) is approximately \(\boxed{4}\) centimeters.

We can substitute this into the equation and get:

$\lceil k + 2 \rceil + \lfloor{\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1}}\rfloor = 5$

Let's analyze the floor function $\lfloor{\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1}}\rfloor$ for different ranges of $k$:

If $k < -1$, then $-1 \leq \frac{1}{k + 1} < 0$, so $\lfloor{\frac{1}{k + 1}}\rfloor = -1$ and thus $\lfloor{\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1}}\rfloor = 2 - 1 = 1$.
If $k = -1$, then $\frac{1}{k + 1}$ is undefined and we can't use it in the floor function.
If $k = 0$, then $\frac{1}{k + 1} = 1$, so $\lfloor{\frac{1}{k + 1}}\rfloor = 1$ and thus $\lfloor{\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1}}\rfloor = 2 + 1 = 3$.
If $k > 0$, then $0 < \frac{1}{k + 1} < 1$, so $\lfloor{\frac{1}{k + 1}}\rfloor = 0$ and thus $\lfloor{\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1}}\rfloor = 2 + 0 = 2$.
Now, let's substitute this into the equation:

$\lceil k + 2 \rceil + \lfloor{\frac{2k + 3}{k + 1}}\rfloor = 5$

If $k < -1$, the equation becomes $\lceil k + 2 \rceil + 1 = 5$, or $\lceil k + 2 \rceil = 4$ which has no integer solutions.
If $k = -1$, we can't use this value because $\frac{1}{k + 1}$ is undefined.
If $k = 0$, the equation becomes $\lceil k + 2 \rceil + 3 = 5$, or $\lceil k + 2 \rceil = 2$ which has the solution $k = 0$.
If $k > 0$, the equation becomes $\lceil k + 2 \rceil + 2 = 5$, or $\lceil k + 2 \rceil = 3$ which has the solution $k = 1$.

Let's denote the width of the path as $x$ meters. The effective dimensions of the garden, excluding the path, are $(30 - 2x)m$ and $(40 - 2x)m$, given that the path runs along all borders inside the garden. The area of the garden minus the path then is $(30 - 2x)(40 - 2x)$ square meters. We also know that this area is equal to half of the garden's original area, which means:

The area of each of these right triangles is 1/2 base * height, and since the triangles are congruent, we can calculate the area of one and then double it to get the total area of the quadrilateral.

The base of one of these right triangles is the distance from (0,N) to ($(\sqrt{2} - 1) \cdot N$, $N$) which is $(\sqrt{2} - 1) \cdot N$.

First, let's find a general formula for $p_n$.
If the first toss is tails (probability 1/2), then the probability of no two consecutive heads in the first $n$ tosses is the same as the probability of no two consecutive heads in the first $n-1$ tosses.
If the first toss is heads (probability 1/2), then to avoid two consecutive heads, the second toss must be tails (probability 1/2), and then the probability of no two consecutive heads in the remaining $n-2$ tosses is $p_{n-2}$.

$P(x) - p_0 - p_1x = \frac{1}{2}x(P(x) - p_0) + \frac{1}{4}x^2P(x)$ 
Substituting $p_0 = 1$ and $p_1 = 1$, we get: $P(x) - 1 - x = \frac{1}{2}x(P(x) - 1) + \frac{1}{4}x^2P(x)$
Solving for $P(x)$: $P(x) - 1 - x = \frac{1}{2}xP(x) - \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{4}x^2P(x)$
$P(x)(1 - \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{4}x^2) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}x$
$P(x) = \frac{1 + \frac{1}{2}x}{1 - \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{4}x^2} = \frac{4 + 2x}{4 - 2x - x^2}$
Now, we want to find $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{p_n}{2^n}$. 
Note that this is the value of $P(\frac{1}{2}) - \frac{p_0}{2^0}$: $P(\frac{1}{2}) - 1 = \frac{4 - 1}{4 - 1 - \frac{1}{4}} - 1 = \frac{20}{11} - 1 = \frac{9}{11}$
Therefore, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{p_n}{2^n} = \frac{9}{11}$."

Simplify your final answer as much as possible.","To solve this, let's break it down into cases:

Case 1: 2 men and 3 women
We can choose 2 men out of 8 in $\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways.
We can choose 3 women out of 6 in $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways.
So there are $28 \cdot 20 = 560$ ways to choose 2 men and 3 women.

Case 2: 3 men and 2 women 
We can choose 3 men out of 8 in $\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways.
We can choose 2 women out of 6 in $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways.
So there are $56 \cdot 15 = 840$ ways to choose 3 men and 2 women.

Adding up the cases:
$560 + 840 = 1400$

Therefore, there are 1400 ways to choose a team of 5 people with at least 2 men and 2 women from a group of 8 men and 6 women."

claude-3-opus-20240229,"['multiplication_and_division', 'complex_number_skills']",What is the value of $\frac{(-2+5i)(3-4i)}{(-1+2i)^2}$? Express your answer in the form $a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.,"First, let's simplify the numerator and the denominator separately.

The numerator is: $(-2+5i)(3-4i) = -6 + 8i + 15i - 20i^2 = -6 + 23i + 20 = 14 + 23i$

The denominator is: $(-1+2i)^2 = 1 - 4i + 4i^2 = 1 - 4i - 4 = -3 - 4i$

Now, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator. To do this, we multiply and divide by the conjugate of the denominator:

$\frac{14 + 23i}{-3 - 4i} = \frac{(14 + 23i)(-3 + 4i)}{(-3 - 4i)(-3 + 4i)}$

Let's simplify:

$\frac{-42 + 56i - 69i + 92i^2}{9 + 12i - 12i + 16} = \frac{-42 -13i - 92}{25} = \frac{-134 -13i}{25}$

Finally, we divide each part of the numerator by the denominator, giving us: $-5.36 - 0.52i$ as the final answer."
